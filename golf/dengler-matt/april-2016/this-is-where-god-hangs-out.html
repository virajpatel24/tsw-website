				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><em>“In your life, have you ever seen anything like it?”</em></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Though Verne Lundquist delivered this famous quote after Tiger Woods’ miraculous pitch shot during the 2005 Masters dropped into the hole after <a href="http://www.masters.com/en_US/watch/2015-04-05/twnnzewjbtruksd0jbkb7ms_2bg4k1mu.html" target="_blank">resting on the lip</a> for what seemed like an eternity, the core essence of Lundquist’s sentiments applies just as much to the Masters Tournament.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">From their first swing, young golfers everywhere dream of standing on the 18th green at Augusta National as the sun drops below the pine trees, wearing arguably the most iconic piece of clothing in the world of sports: the Green Jacket.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">At a young age I saw myself among golf’s greats, one day winning the Masters and earning the chance to don that colorful blazer myself. I spent hours every day beating balls on the driving range, holing three-foot putt after three-foot putt, and fanatically devouring each month’s issue of <em>Golf Magazine</em>, hoping that one more swing-tip would point me in the direction of greatness.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But it was not to be. After spending thousands of hours trying to perfect my game, I never came close to reaching a level where I could conceive of qualifying for the Masters - or any other professional tournament, for that matter. But my lack of success only fuels my admiration for those golfers who <em>have</em> managed to reach that glorious level.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Those lucky enough to compete in this year’s Masters will be rewarded with an experience they will never forget. From the vibrant azaleas of “Amen Corner” to the ceremonial opening tee shots, the Masters experience is as distinct as the famous pimento cheese sandwiches they whip up at Augusta National.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Tradition. Challenge. Perfection.</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">While the U.S. Open, British Open, and PGA Championship are played at different courses each year, the Masters is golf’s only major championship played at the same golf course - The Augusta National Golf Club - every season.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Augusta National was designed by golf legend Bobby Jones in 1934. It first held the Augusta National Invitation Tournament in 1934, which was renamed “The Masters” in 1936.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Ever since, the finest players golf has to offer have congregated at Augusta each year to test their skills against one another. Rarely a year goes by without a thrilling finish on the 18th green, or even a short cart ride back to the 10th tee box for a sudden-death playoff.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Winning the Masters is essential if a golfer wants to be classified among golf’s all-time greats. The legends of the sport have all won this tournament multiple times, with Jack Nicklaus claiming victory at Augusta a whopping six times. Arnold Palmer and Tiger Woods are right there with the “Golden Bear”, each having donned the Green Jacket on four separate occasions.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Golfers toil their entire careers for a chance to play in this competition. Their thirst for a chance to be in contention during Sunday’s final round is insatiable. Though the prize money is immense (last year’s champion Jordan Spieth won $1,800,000), the eye-popping dollar amount has always been an afterthought. Winning the Masters is all about earning your place in history; everything else comes second.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“If the Masters offered no money at all, I would be here trying just as hard.”</p>
				
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">- <a href="http://espn.go.com/espn/page2/index?id=6323285" target="_blank">Ben Hogan</a>, two-time Masters champion</p>
				</div>
					
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But the Masters Tournament would never have reached this level of universal prestige without a golf course of the finest quality.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Augusta National is the personification of perfection, plain and simple. From the perfectly sculpted emerald fairways to the agony-inducing greens, there is no finer test of ability than the eighteen holes at Augusta. While Amen Corner has caused many a golfer to pray to the golf Gods for help, no aspect of Augusta National has caused more nightmares and heartache than the menacing greens.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“Every shot is within a fraction of disaster -- that's what makes it so great.”</p>
				
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">- <a href="http://espn.go.com/espn/page2/index?id=6323285" target="_blank">Gary Player</a>, three-time Masters champion</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">As any seasoned veteran of the Masters will tell you, the more you play the course, the more you learn about it. But the greens at Augusta National have always been difficult to master. The same green can be both viciously fast and painfully slow, depending on where your ball is on the green. And don’t forget about Rae’s Creek, winding throughout the back-nine and deceptively drawing wayward putts toward its watery depths. Augusta’s greens are “<a href="http://www.pressreader.com/usa/the-arizona-republic/20150404/282260958974163/TextView" target="_blank">just plain crazy</a>,” leaving you forever flummoxed about your three-putt catastrophe from only eight feet away on the wily 11th hole.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“The crazy thing about those greens is we see them every year. We study them every year. We putt on them every year. And you still don't understand what happens to some of those putts. You just can’t believe what some of those putts do.”</p>
				
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">- <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2015/04/05/masters-augusta-national-greens-zach-johnson/25327247/" target="_blank">Bubba Watson</a>, two-time Masters champion</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Along with the rich history and splendor of Augusta National, the traditions of Masters week sets it apart from every other golf tournament. These traditions have developed over the last eighty years, resulting in the most unique tournament environment in the world.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">It all starts with the Champions Dinner. On the Tuesday before the Masters begins, each of the previous Masters winners is invited back to Augusta for a celebratory dinner where the defending Masters champion chooses what’s on the menu. Ranging anywhere from haggis to wild boar, these dinner choices have varied wildly throughout the years and always make for an interesting story during Masters week.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">On Wednesday afternoon, only hours away from the opening round on Thursday morning, the Masters competitors, past champions, and their families make their way to Augusta’s par three course for an afternoon of fun. While some prefer to spend the day enjoying a leisurely stroll around the course, others take it far more seriously, yearning to earn their spot in the Masters record books any way they can. But this may not be a wise idea, since no Par 3 Contest champion has ever gone on to win the Masters the same year. Who knows, maybe Jimmy Walker can end the streak and take home both titles this season.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Bright and early Thursday morning before the first tee time, three of golf’s legends tee off down Augusta’s first fairway to signal the start of the tournament. Though these legendary figures have rotated over time, for the last four years Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, and Gary Player have been the honorary starters. Make no mistake, even though these guys have long retired from competitive golf, they are just as competitive as ever, each trying to win “their Masters” by outdriving the other honorary starters.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">A discussion of the Masters would not be complete without mentioning the most devoted followers of golf in the world: the Augusta patrons. These people are so fanatical that the word “fans” is not an adequate descriptor; instead, they are referred to as “patrons.” Patrons don’t just go with the flow during their time at the Masters; they arrive at Augusta in their finest golf attire, having planned out their every move long before they reach the front gate. With their ticket hanging from their neck on a $6.99 ticket holder they’ve preserved since 1982, patrons take off across Augusta’s grounds excited for the best weekend of the year. Masters tickets are few of the toughest to obtain, the difficulty level on par with securing a Super Bowl or a World Cup final ticket. It’s this exclusivity that contributes to the passion that patrons bring to the event, and the seriousness with which they take their viewing experience.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">What makes Augusta such a special place aren’t just the patrons, the traditions, or the beautiful scenery surrounding the course, it’s all of those defining moments combining to form something otherworldly. Every piece fits together to provide both golfers and fans with an experience unlike any other. And if you aren’t lucky enough to walk the grounds during Masters week each April, watching on T.V. remains a close second.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Any golf fan will tell you that sitting in a comfortable chair while watching the Masters on a hulking, crystal-clear, high-definition television is as close to true happiness as we can attain in this world. To top it off, Augusta limits the amount of commercials shown during broadcasts of the Masters. So for about fifty minutes each hour, it’s pure, unadulterated bliss.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The splendor of Augusta National and the ghosts of golf legends wandering the fairways lend it an air of magic unmatched and untouched by anything else in the world of golf. The Masters truly is a competition unlike any other, and I hope you’ll join me in watching this weekend.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b><u>Players to Watch</u></b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Now that you’ve been convinced to watch the Masters, which players should you be paying attention to? Here are some players worth following closely, especially on the scintillating Saturday and Sunday rounds.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>The Obvious Ones</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>1. Jordan Spieth</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Everybody knows Jordan Spieth. The two-time major winner and defending Masters champion has become golf’s most recognizable figure at only twenty-two years old. In addition to winning the Masters in 2015, he tied for second in 2014 in his only other Masters appearance. He is the consensus “Best Golfer in the World.” The ladies love his boyish good looks, and the gentlemen know within their bones that he’s the most prepared to carry on Tiger’s legacy for many years to come. He’s got a lot going for him. So he’s the clear favorite, right?</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Actually, no. According to Vegas, one other golfer has better odds of wearing the Green Jacket on Sunday night. Much of this has to do with Spieth’s struggles during the current PGA season. After his historic 2015 season, Spieth has not played well so far this year, at least by his elite standards. He only has three top-ten finishes out of seven events this calendar year, even missing the cut at the Northern Trust Open in February. He also admitted to <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2623927-whats-wrong-with-jordan-spieth-and-should-we-be-worried" target="_blank">struggling with fame</a> during his current rise to stardom.</p></div>
				
				<img src="apr-golf-article-images/spieth.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a href="http://www.masters.com/en_US/index.html" target="_blank">WWW.MASTERS.COM</a></p>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But don’t count out the young Texan based on his recent struggles. He is without a doubt the best golfer in the world, and he clearly feels comfortable at Augusta National. I would be more than surprised to see him finish outside the top five this weekend.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>2. Jason Day</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">I mentioned in the previous section that only one golfer had better odds than Spieth to win the Masters. Well, prepare to meet him.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Jason Day is currently the top ranked golfer in the world. Though much of this has to do with Spieth’s recent struggles, this shouldn’t take away from how well Day has played over the last year.</p></div>
				
				<img src="apr-golf-article-images/day.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a href="http://www.masters.com/en_US/index.html" target="_blank">WWW.MASTERS.COM</a></p>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Day has enjoyed one of the best stretches of golf we have seen in a very long time. He has six wins, including the 2015 PGA Championship, in his last fourteen tournaments. He also won two of the last three events he participated in, one of which was the renowned World Golf Championships Match Play tournament. It’s hard to imagine a player coming into the Masters in better form than Day.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">As if all of that wasn’t enough, like Spieth, Day is frighteningly comfortable at Augusta, having finished second and third at the Masters in previous years. His fantastic short game is perfectly suited for Augusta’s mind-boggling greens, and his past success should provide him with the necessary confidence to attack Augusta head-on. If I was a betting man, which, if you know me, I am, I would put my money on the talented Australian.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>3. Bubba Watson</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Bubba Watson may be the most entertaining player in all of golf. A “good ol’ boy” from Bagdad, Florida, Bubba hits the ball a country mile and has a good time doing it.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">For example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PM2NocuEihw" target="_blank">this video featuring Bubba shirtless in overalls</a> is the funniest golf-related thing I’ve ever seen. We still have no idea as to why this actually happened, but it speaks to Bubba’s light-heartedness and is indicative of the fun he brings to what can occasionally be an overly serious game. And to top it off, he’s got a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sWVRLUPxHQ" target="_blank">hovercraft golf cart</a>, which is pretty awesome in its own right.</p></div>
				
				<img src="apr-golf-article-images/bubba.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a href="http://www.masters.com/en_US/index.html" target="_blank">WWW.MASTERS.COM</a></p>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But Bubba isn’t only about having fun; he’s also one of the best golfers in the world. He’s already won the Masters twice, in 2012 and 2014, and provided the golf world with, arguably, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W00lrCnG-B8" target="_blank">most spectacular shot</a> in Masters history.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This fourth-ranked golfer in the world has been firing on all cylinders this season, winning the Northern Trust Open in February, and following that up with a runner-up finish at the WGC Cadillac Championship the very next week.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">He’s the guy I would want in my Saturday afternoon foursome; I guarantee he’d bring the beer. And there’s a good chance he’ll be celebrating his third Masters victory <a href="http://espn.go.com/golf/masters14/story/_/id/10780235/bubba-watson-celebrates-late-night-meal-waffle-house" target="_blank">at the local Waffle House</a> this Sunday night.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>The Not-So-Obvious Contenders</b></p></div>				
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>1. Louis Oosthuizen</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">One of the most forgotten major champions of the modern era, Louis Oosthuizen always seems to hang around the top of the leaderboard in major championships. He is a seasoned veteran at Augusta, who has a second place finish at the Masters already under his belt. Oosthuizen has also holed one of only four double eagles in Masters history with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZoUJZ0yDTA" target="_blank">this phenomenal four iron</a> from the second fairway.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">“Shrek”, as he is affectionately known around the PGA Tour for the gap between his front teeth, has finished in the top fourteen spots in seven of his last nine events. He’s hitting the ball as well as he has at any point in his career, and sits just outside the top 10 in the world golf rankings. Along with Jason Day and Bubba Watson, Oosthuizen is playing the best golf of any player in the Masters field. His fantastic play and successful Masters history has the South African primed for a run at the 2016 Masters title.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>2. Brooks Koepka</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Unlike the previous four golfers I mentioned, Brooks Koepka does not have much PGA Tour of major championship experience. Although he’s not a PGA Tour veteran, he has played on the European Tour since 2012. At only 25 years old, he is already one of the biggest hitters on the Tour, averaging a whopping 307.4 yards per drive so far this season. But Koepka’s game is far from just brute force. His background on the European Tour, combined with the harsh weather conditions he faced on a regular basis, have forced him to fine-tune the flight and accuracy of his approach shots, placing him among the game’s elite shot makers.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Perhaps Koepka’s highest praise comes from Tiger Woods’ former caddy, <a href="http://www.golfdigest.com/story/the-buzz-on-brooks-koepka" target="_blank">Steve Williams</a>, who said, “Once in a great while, a player comes along who hits a golf ball the way it was meant to be hit. Powerful, piercing, the perfect trajectory. Of the young players out there, one I’ve seen has that special ball flight: Brooks Koepka...I haven’t seen a ball flight like that since Tiger, and before that, Johnny Miller.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">During his short stint on the PGA Tour, Koepka has showcased his ability to succeed in major championships with top-five finishes in the U.S. Open and PGA Championship, and a top-ten finish in the British Open. I’m willing to bet he adds another top-ten major championship finish to his resume this weekend.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>3. Phil Mickelson</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">You may be surprised that Phil Mickelson has made my “Not-So-Obvious” list since he is one of the biggest names in golf over the last fifteen to twenty years. However, he has struggled mightily with his game, especially his putter, over the last two years. He even dropped out of the top thirty in world rankings during the 2015 season.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">However, Phil has shown signs of life over the past few months, earning three top-five finishes so far this season. He seems to have a newfound appetite for the game, something he admits to losing during the 2014 and 2015 seasons. He also has a lot to play for this season. At 45 years old, Mickelson simply doesn’t have many more years of his best golf left. He wants to leave no doubt about his spot on the 2016 Ryder Cup, as it could be his last time competing. Winning the Masters would be a major step in the right direction.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Phil is no stranger to success at Augusta. His closet already houses three Green Jackets, more than any other player in this year’s field. Mickelson can also boast of his twelve incredible top-ten finishes at the Masters in the other years. It is difficult to bet against a player with all of Phil’s past achievements at Augusta, and considering the progress he has made and his success this season, I would be far from surprised to watch the “Hefty Lefty” walk away with his fourth Green Jacket this weekend.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Bryson DeChambeau</b> - Still technically an amateur, but has the game of a seasoned professional. “The Mad Scientist” is meshing golf skills with physics knowledge in an extremely interesting way, and is a guy to look out for in the very near future. I wouldn’t be surprised in the slightest to see him make a run up the Masters leaderboard this weekend.</p></div>
