				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The North London derby between Arsenal and Tottenham is one of the most watched and eagerly anticipated clashes in every Premier League season. Over the years, these two bitter rivals have faced off in the Premier League, the FA Cup, the League Cup, and the famous Champions League…oh wait, the Champions League battle hasn’t occurred yet given Spurs’ general aversion to greatness. And that probably explains why <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3305106/Arsenal-news-Tottenham-congratulate-Bayern-Munich-Twitter-rubs-salt-Gunners-fresh-Champions-League-wounds.html" target="_blank">a perennial, but jealous Europa League side</a> took to Twitter to take jabs at Arsenal for their 5–1 meltdown against Bayern Munich midweek in the Champions League.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">I would point out Tottenham’s recent foibles, but I wouldn’t want to tear someone’s glass house down. Heading into the match on Sunday night in North London, Tottenham had slipped a bit into sixth place in the EPL table after West Ham moved up to fifth thanks to their 1–1 draw against Everton on Saturday. For Arsenal, good news poured in before the opening kick-off even took place when the Gunners heard about Manchester City’s 0–0 draw against a middling Aston Villa side earlier in the day.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">If Tottenham came out with a draw or a win in this match, they would reclaim fifth place. But if Arsenal came out with a win, they would obtain sole possession of first place (a draw would keep them level with Man City for first). Given the sheer magnitude of the matchup, I decided there wouldn’t arrive a more fortuitous time to do a “Running Diary” column. So, as planned, here’s my perspective on the North London derby.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">(As a note, the times listed below are when the match took place here in the United States. Since London is five hours ahead of the U.S.’s EST, if you want to know the times in Britain at any point, just add five hours to my listed time.)</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>11:00 AM EST</b> — The teams have already walked out to the beautifully trimmed and tapered Emirates pitch. The opening handshakes are complete. In case you’re wondering, Harry Kane hasn’t given the “I can’t keep my eyes off of him” lingering glances to anybody yet. Not gonna lie, that was some weird stuff from Tottenham’s Citizen Kane.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>11:01 AM</b> — Classy touch by all of the Premier League sides this weekend by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1213156492042097.1073742194.220832481274508" target="_blank">having a moment of silence</a> before the opening kickoff. If you don’t know, Remembrance weekend occurred this weekend in England, and some time is allocated to the observance of a moment of silence all across Britain. The weekend itself commemorates those fallen in the line of duty as well as the armistice signed “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" target="_blank">at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month</a>” that officially signified the end of World War I.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>11:02 AM</b> — With the pre-match activities finished, the players were lined up and ready to kick-off the match. Within seconds of kick-off, NBC Sports’ fantastic commentary team of Arlo White, Lee Dixon, and Graeme Le Saux begin discussing Arsenal’s recent shortcomings. White immediately brings up the 5–1 debacle that Arsenal suffered midweek at the hands of Bayern Munich. I have a feeling that this won’t be the first and only time…</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>11:04 AM</b> — Not much has taken place in the opening minutes of the match as both teams try and retain possession for short stretches of time. Suddenly, Arsenal launch a long through ball towards Olivier Giroud (who is starting in the place of the injured Theo Walcott), who starts running at full speed towards the ball. Of course, lacking Walcott’s speed and agility, Giroud comes woefully short, but we do arrive on Arlo White’s first alliteration of the game: “Galloping Giroud.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>11:05 AM</b> — Almost as if they’d gone far too long without mentioning the Bayern Munich result and fearing being zapped into mentioning it by the NBC Sports’ producers, Graeme Le Saux brings it up without any need to do so. Silence is golden, fellas!</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>11:06 AM</b> — Now that they’ve linked up a steady chain of passes in midfield, Arsenal lose the ball (because why not?), defend aggressively in their own half, win back the ball, go on a counterattack spearheaded by Super Santi Cazorla, only to watch Olivier Giroud hand it right back to Spurs. This could be a long night.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>11:07 AM</b> — Okay, this is starting to get annoying real fast. THIRD mention of the Bayern disaster!!! And, NBC Sports is getting creative/sneaky with it, too. Instead of bringing it up via the White, Dixon, and Le Saux commentary team, they surreptitiously displayed the relevant information below the scoreboard.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Time to retaliate…</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">NBC: LOST THE HIGHLY COVETED “<a href="http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/cbs-week-viewing-diary-day-5-americas-most-watched-network-will-pay-dearly-for-what-it-did-to-the-mccarthys/" target="_blank">AMERICA’S MOST WATCHED NETWORK</a>” TITLE TO CBS</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Given how much having that title means to TV networks, I think we’re even now. Unless they bring up the Bayern match for a fourth time, which they probably will.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>11:08 AM</b> — According to the NBC Sports’ commentary team, they recall Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino saying, “Players don’t remember history.” Then Lee Dixon goes into a diatribe about how they do. You don’t have to convince me, Lee — Steven Gerrard has said <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/24/steven-gerrard-liverpool-slip-chelsea-premier-league-title" target="_blank">over</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNAMAjLaPaY&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">over again</a> how much “the slip” still haunts him. Players remember history.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>11:09 AM</b> — The 23-year-old Joel Campbell looks absolutely capable of making that right wing spot his own for Arsenal in the years to come. In the first seven minutes of this match, he’s had about 25 successful one-on-ones and preserved his dribble and the ball spectacularly amongst the pressure of the Tottenham press.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Arlo White mentions how this is only Campbell’s second Premier League start. His first one came last weekend at Swansea where he ended up contributing his first goal. Of course, now that he’s shown much more promise than the great Yaya Sanogo ever did, Gunners fans can breathe more easily knowing that Arsène Wenger probably won’t be sending Campbell out on his 18th loan spell any time soon.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>11:11 AM</b> — Santi Cazorla has shown glimpses of his greatness thus far. And his touch and control on the ball are nicely complementing his ethereal passing and vision. His midfield partner Francis Coquelin is also doing what he does best: Diving full steam into bone-crunching tackles and winning the ball in the process.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Spurs players like Harry Kane, Christian Eriksen, and Mousa Dembélé haven’t really done much so far since Arsenal’s possessed the ball for long stretches of the clock.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>11:12 AM</b> — Speaking of Kane, since he’s the team’s sole attacker, Graeme Le Saux smartly points out how Kane’s deliberately playing right near the Arsenal high line consisting of Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny. “He’s playing right on the last defender,” Le Saux offers.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Keep this in mind because Kane’s efforts will pay off soon enough.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>11:13 AM</b> — The first chinks in Arsenal’s armor are appearing as the Gunners begin to lose their pristine touch and control of the ball. First, Mesut Özil meanders through a litany of Tottenham players only to slip and lose the ball. Then Alexis Sánchez recovers the ball and he also slips and gives the ball away. Érik Lamela, while not having much of an impact offensively for Spurs, does defend superbly on both of those Özil-Sánchez gaffes.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>11:14 AM</b> — Since neither team can keep the ball longer than 20 or 30 seconds at a time so far, Joel Campbell decides to sprint down the right flank with it to see if he can break that logjam all by himself. Of course, Spurs players hound him in threes and fours, but somehow the finicky Costa Rican manages to shield, fake, and impress his way out of that tricky situation. All in all, he’s probably been on the ball for 20 straight seconds, which is impressive in and of itself.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>11:15 AM</b> — As play proceeds on the pitch, Arlo White expounds upon Pochettino’s excellent use of his players. In fact, according to White, “The average age in the Tottenham win against Man City was 24 years and 40 days for Tottenham.” And considering how hard Pochettino forces his young players to work in practice, it’s no surprise that they’ve managed to remain in the top fourth of the table.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">It just goes to show you, all the money in the world can’t keep you in the top fourth of the Premier League table. But it can keep you in the bottom fourth! Am I right, Chelsea?</p></div>
				
				<img src="nov-epl-images/chelsea-table.png" class="each_epl_image">
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>11:17 AM</b> — Building off Arlo’s initial point about Tottenham’s youth, NBC Sports displayed a corresponding fact below the scoreboard to shed some more insights about Spurs’ lockdown defense led by Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen.</p></div>
				
				<img src="nov-epl-images/tottenham-defense-stat.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">COURTESY OF NBC SPORTS</p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>11:18 AM</b> — Of course, there’s always that one guy that kills the original joke/point. Lee Dixon begins his soliloquy about Spurs and their recent successes and ends by saying, “If they can cut out those mistakes and get those relationships really strong, then yeah, of course, they can come more alive or become more tougher.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Got it, Dr. Love.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>11:19 AM</b> — Dixon, or Dr. Love, has now also gone and killed the term “soft underbelly” by using it to describe Tottenham’s overall Premier League performances this season. Just like his TV network’s overuse of the Bayern match, I have a feeling Dr. Love’s going to shamelessly keep on using “soft underbelly.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>11:21 AM</b> — Tottenham obtain their first corner of the match. As the kick’s being taken, Lee Dixon dips back into his 1-page dictionary and pulls out “soft underbelly” for the fourth time. Tottenham’s corner doesn’t lead to anything. Maybe they DO have a “soft underbelly.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>11:22 AM</b> — Tottenham still retain possession of the ball and rapidly begin building up their next attack. However, thanks to a great touchline tackle from Francis Coquelin, Arsenal is able to go on the counter. Alexis carries the ball all the way to Tottenham’s half from the left flank before the attack fizzles out.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>11:24 AM</b> — Having gone almost 15 minutes without bringing up the Bayern match, Arlo White delivers the news for the FOURTH time via a Wenger quote, “After the Bayern Munich result we need to do extremely well in the Premier League.” I’m telling you: NBC Sports is getting creative with this.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>11:24 AM</b> — Of course, it wouldn’t be a soccer match if we didn’t have the customary “get-kicked-in-literally-any-other-body-part-and-go-down-clutching-your-face” routine from Tottenham’s Danny Rose.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>11:26 AM</b> — Santi Cazorla, he who led a handful of those early Arsenal attacks and counterattacks, is noticeably in decline now as he’s mistiming his passes and losing possession of the ball. Credit to Spurs for relentlessly pressing him and wearing him down so early in the match.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>11:27 AM</b> — Christian Eriksen lines up for a free kick 10 yards or so outside the penalty box. His kick, however, finds an open Eric Dier who can’t head in the shot from point-blank range. It’s safe to say Arsenal’s man-to-man marking scheme utterly crashed-and-burned during that set piece.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>11:28 AM</b> — Awesome long pass from Alexis Sánchez to Olivier Giroud, who is left relatively open and only needs to head the ball to a Mesut Özil right in front of him annnnnddddd…Giroud heads it five feet to Özil’s left, giving the ball right back to Tottenham…YOU HAD ONE JOB, OLIVIER! ONE JOB!</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>11:32 AM</b> — After Nacho Monreal does a stellar job of warding off the Tottenham attack, Lee Dixon offers, “Spurs have gotten much more rhythm these last ten minutes.” Dr. Love’s correct. Arsenal’s play has dropped off a cliff in recent minutes due to Spurs’ suffocating high press.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>11:33 AM</b> — This is how the latest White-Dixon-Le Saux (paraphrased) conversation went down regarding Christian Eriksen’s place in the Tottenham Starting XI:</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Le Saux: “Play Eriksen more centrally to get more out of him.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Dixon: “Give him a free role either on the left or the center of the pitch.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">White: “Giroud runs into Eriksen.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Well, then.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>11:35 AM</b> — As we approach the 31:30 mark, Tottenham is pinging the ball back-and-forth between Alderweireld, Vertonghen, and Danny Rose. Then, out of nowhere, Danny Rose launches a perfectly weighted, looping long ball towards a sprinting Harry Kane who lets that perfect ball dribble a few more times before he slots it past a diving Petr Čech for the match’s opening goal.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>11:35 AM</b> — Stomach punch. Totally didn’t expect that to happen out of the blue.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>11:35 AM</b> — Still keeled over in pain.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>11:35 AM</b> — Starting to come around slowly. It helped that I kept saying to myself things like “We can still win this” and “It could be worse, I could be a Spurs fan.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>11:36 AM</b> — Okay, the last one about not being a Spurs fan helped out a lot. It’s such a blessing to have avoided that in life. I’m back.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>11:36 AM</b> — I’m back to being sad again now that Arlo White has decided this would be a great a time as any to point out how Harry Kane used to belong to Arsenal’s academy in his youth days before Wenger let him go to Tottenham. LE PROFESSEUR, HOW COULD YOU???</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>11:37 AM</b> — As the match resumes play, Lee Dixon begins playing the “Who’s to blame?” game for the Harry Kane goal and, after some reflection, arrives upon Mertesacker and Coquelin as the prime culprits. I agree.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>11:38 AM</b> — Somehow, the referee (Martin Atkinson) and his assistants completely miss the “Diego Costa-Gabriel incident 2.0” taking place in the Tottenham half as Vertonghen shoves Giroud to the ground. Giroud, not one to take things calmly when irked, immediately retaliates and pushes Vertonghen to the ground as well. And the referees (to their credit?) completely miss the call and let play proceed undisturbed.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But the main takeaway for me was the fact that Vertonghen’s perfectly combed hair remained that way even after all that shoving and pushing with Giroud. What hair gel (and how much of it) does he use???</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>11:39 AM</b> — Giroud pleads his case to Martin Atkinson as Vertonghen arrives to provide his rebuttal. I’d be much happier if Giroud used his expert negotiating tactics to negotiate a goal instead of failingly negotiating a yellow card for his opponent.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>11:40 AM</b> — Now charged up by the Harry Kane goal and the fact that Vertonghen slipped past Atkinson’s yellow card, Spurs fans began singing in full chorus “Oh When the Spurs Go Marching In.” I’m about to suffer through the worst minute of my life.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>11:41 AM</b> — The worst minute of my life ends as Spurs fans bellow the final verse. Then, on cue, Santi Cazorla begins the Arsenal attack with a pass to Campbell on the right flank, who crosses it to Alexis right in front of Hugo Lloris’s goal. Unfortunately, the Chilean came up with a weak shot that Lloris handled easily. But even if it had gone in, it wouldn’t have counted since Alexis was offsides.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>11:42 AM</b> — NBC Sports replays the Kane goal. WE GAVE THIS GUY AWAY TO A TEAM LIKE TOTTENHAM???</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But on a more serious note, Harry Kane’s ongoing efforts to stay close to Arsenal’s high defensive line from the start of the match paid off gloriously from him. In order to play that high line effectively, Koscielny and Mertesacker both have to be on the same wavelengths and since Danny Rose launched that perfect long ball out of nowhere, Koscielny pressed up while Mertesacker didn’t (keeping Kane onsides). That moment’s hesitation and mistake from Mertesacker meant Koscielny had to pop a U-turn and quickly go after Harry Kane. And Kane’s superior awareness in front of goal was going to make it absolutely certain that he ended up with either the goal (at best) or a penalty kick (at worst).</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>11:47 AM</b> — As we approach the final minute of the first 45, Arsenal loses the ball in midfield and Spurs go on the attack, which ends in a Kane shot from the right side of the penalty box.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>11:48 AM</b> — On a 50–50 ball, Dele Alli easily shoves Cazorla out of the way. But Arsenal and Mesut Özil recover the ball and the German delivers the perfect defense-splitting pass. However, it simply has too much weight on it and Giroud fails to latch onto it by a mile.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>12:04 PM EST</b> — Mathieu “<a href="http://www.sbnation.com/soccer/2015/9/24/9391427/arsenal-tottenham-hotspur-league-cup-mathieu-flamini" target="_blank">Spurs Killer</a>” Flamini is substituted into the match for a struggling Santi Cazorla. Lee Dixon: “Good substitution. Arsenal have to streamline those mistakes they’ve been making.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>12:06 PM</b> — Arlo White takes the time to remind the viewing audience of the stakes at hand: “If Arsenal win, they go to the top of the table (two points clear). If Tottenham win, they’ll be fifth.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>12:07 PM</b> — Brilliant shot and playmaking from Joel Campbell, but the shot is saved in time by the excellent Hugo Lloris.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>12:10 PM</b> — Spurs go on the attack, which leads to an Eriksen shot from the right flank that had the potential to make it 2–0 Spurs had Petr Čech not extended a hand out in time.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>12:12 PM</b> — As Tottenham control the brunt on the possession, we are introduced to the Ronaldinho-esqe dribbling styles of defensive midfielder Mousa Dembélé. Of course, Dembélé’s nifty footwork got him out of trouble rather elaborately, but I’m sure Spurs fans didn’t enjoy his “hero” tactics deep in Arsenal’s half.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>12:12 PM</b> — When not busy plying his trade as a slower Ronaldinho, Dembélé was pivotal in bringing down Joel Campbell on the right flank. Mesut Özil lined up for the subsequent free kick and sent a swerving ball right to Olivier Giroud…who makes great contact with it, but ends up hitting the ball right off of the top bar of Hugo Lloris’s goal.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Close miss #1 for Giroud.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>12:14 PM</b> — Tottenham’s Érik Lamela, who has played a decent game up till now, launches a diving challenge on an unsuspecting Coquelin. It was enough to warrant the straight yellow from referee Atkinson. This was Lamela’s fifth yellow this season, so he’ll be missing the West Ham match after this week’s international break.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>12:15 PM</b> — Petr Čech realizes the back pass to him is too slow and won’t reach him in time, <b>so he leaves his penalty box</b> to kick it out, and he successfully gets past a lunging Spurs player only to slow down and take like a good 15 minutes to decide what to do next. WHAT ARE YOU DOING, PETR?!?! KICK THE DANG BALL!!! DON’T JUST STAND THERE, MAN!</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Thankfully, the Czech goalkeeper makes up his mind and passes the ball out of reach. Whew!</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>12:22 PM</b> — Apparently, the near scare and his dillydallying on the ball has spurred Petr Čech back into action. After a great defensive press from Spurs, they win the ball and Kyle Walker gets the low pass off from the right flank to a slaloming Christian Eriksen who fires a vicious curling shot towards Čech, who, in full dive, gets the save.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Great save #1 from Čech. Many more to come.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Easily the most surreal and awkward moment of NBC Sports’ coverage of this match.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>12:27 PM</b> — Mathieu  Flamini and Francis Coquelin channel their inner David Beckham and start launching these long passes to Alexis from deep in the Arsenal half. Of course, even Alexis’s preternatural ball control isn’t enough to bring down those shoddy passes and so the counterattacks stall more than once.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Just short pass the ball up the pitch people! Not that hard.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>12:28 PM</b> — Tottenham’s Toby Alderweireld comes up with a brilliant header from point-blank range right at Čech from a corner kick. Čech somehow delivers a BRILLIANT, last-ditch reaction save! He’s keeping the Gunners in this game in the second half. It could easily be 5–0 by now to Spurs had it not been him in goal.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Great save #2 from Čech.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>12:29 PM</b> —Mesut Özil has entered the “I’m going to be strolling around defensively from now on” phase of the match. Only it doesn’t help that Arsenal is behind by a point with only 20 minutes remaining.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Surprisingly, when I was looking at the post-match statistics, Özil created a litany of chances for the Gunners in the second half and easily made up for his lack of effort (at times) defensively.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In fact, he covers the fourth most distance per match in Arsenal’s Premier League matches this season, which thoroughly surprised me since I would have predicted that the likes of the indefatigable Alexis would place above the German in that regards.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>12:31 PM</b> — As the rain starts pouring from the overcast, dark London skies, Mathieu Debuchy lies in a heap on the pitch for a full 40 seconds before Spurs — in pity or sympathy — knock the ball out so that he could get some medical attention. At least Atkinson and his officiating crew are consistent with their aloofness in this match.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>12:32 PM</b> — Wenger makes his second substitution of the match by bringing on Kieran Gibbs in for Joel Campbell. Wait, what?? Why would he bring in a left back in exchange for a winger — especially when his team’s down 1–0 to a Spurs team that’s constantly threatening to score another goal??</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>12:33 PM</b> — Still scratching my head at Wenger’s decision to sub in Gibbs for Campbell…</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But Lee “Dr. Love” Dixon fills the silence by providing his expert analysis of Érik Lamela’s improved and free-flowing game at Spurs as he’s subbed out for Son Heung-min, “He needs to feel loved. And under Pochettino he feels loved.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>12:34 PM</b> — Wenger, in yet another headscratcher move, subs out Debuchy for Mikel Arteta, who, in Arlo White’s best description, is “not an attacking player by any stretch of the imagination.” At this point, I really have no earthly idea as to what Wenger is doing…but that’s Le Professeur for ya!</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>12:35 PM</b> — I was wrong. Wenger is a bona-fide genius! Super-sub Kieran Gibbs somehow latches on the end of a perfectly delivered Mesut Özil cross from the right flank and slams the ball into Lloris’s net. GOALLLLLL!!!!! 1–1!!!!</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>12:37 PM</b> — Now the match has completely swung around in Arsenal’s favor. Spurs and their fans can’t believe what has just transpired and they’re scrambling to put together an attack at the last minute. Arsenal, on the other hand, are calmer than calm and engage in an attacking sequence that involves a Per Mertesacker failed bicycle kick attempt.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">After an Aleix Sánchez low pass into the penalty area to Mertesacker, who immediately attempts a failed bicycle kick (because why not?), the ball lands at Gibbs’ feet, but Hugo Lloris closes it out perfectly. Arsenal corner.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>12:40 PM</b> — Spurs substitute out Dele Alli (who would go on to win the Man of the Match award) for Ryan Mason. Now that Tottenham have given up the Arsenal goal, I’d put a wager on Lee Dixon using “soft underbelly” in the last ten minutes of this match once again to describe their performance.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>12:42 PM</b> — After an Özil corner kick fails, Özil recovers the ball on the right flank and whips in another corner into the box that finds Giroud, who has a clear header that is saved by Lloris. This makes for THREE clear headers that Giroud has failed to put away. The fourth time’s the charm?</p></div>

Lots of gesticulating and ferocity from the Frenchman, which begs the question: Where is that “zoom in” loving cameraman now? THIS is the shot we need that close-up for so we can make out all of the French pleasantries that Wenger’s directing towards the match officials!</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>12:48 PM</b> — A Mesut Özil free kick is coming as we draw upon the final minute of the 90. But Spurs stay tight defensively and allow Harry Kane to begin their counterattack, which fizzles out.</p></div>
