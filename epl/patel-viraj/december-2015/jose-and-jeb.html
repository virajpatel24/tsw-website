				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">These days, having your name mentioned in the same breath as that of José Mourinho just doesn’t carry the same awe and wonderment it once did —  unless you’ve been recently fired from your high-profile full-time job. While you won’t spot the Portuguese next to you in the local unemployment line — thanks to <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3364570/Jose-Mourinho-s-pay-Chelsea-sacking-legal-dispute-Blues-arguing-breached-contract-falling-former-club-doctor-Eva-Carneiro.html" target="_blank">the generous severance package</a> that Chelsea have given him as a parting gift — it’s undeniable that the pressures of the job got to Mourinho long before his final days in West London arrived. The beleaguered former  manager of Chelsea Football Club has had a generally disastrous 2015, as far as his managing career is concerned. Although Chelsea won their fifth Premier League title just last season, the wheels were already preparing to fall off of Mourinho’s Chelsea bus in the second-half of that triumphant season.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">From that standpoint, José’s second stint as the head man at Chelsea mirrors Jeb Bush’s currently failing push for the Republican nomination in the 2016 U.S. presidential race. Both Jeb!’s and José!’s campaigns started off with an exclamation point, and both, in due time, have petered out into an ellipsis, ultimately leaving much to be desired, given the sheer talent and resources that were at each individual’s disposal…</p></div>
				
				<div class="video_container"><iframe class="youtube_video" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/o5kAom55cj8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">George W. Bush’s younger brother initially made a name for himself by winning the Florida governorship in 1999. José Mourinho had no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush" target="_blank">famous brothers</a> (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._W._Bush" target="_blank">fathers</a>) to surpass in his rise to fame, but he still turned heads when he took a massively underrated Porto side to the prestigious Champions League final and beat Monaco 3–0 to bring the club its second such trophy. While Jeb presided over the mess that Florida voters caused during the highly controversial 2000 presidential election, in which his brother narrowly beat out Al Gore, José took over the reins at Benfica, which became his very first attempt at managing a professional football club.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Over the next 13 years, both men’s careers would follow similar twists and turns. Jeb transformed into the darling of the Republican Party and José made a name for himself by winning league titles in Portugal (with Porto), England (with Chelsea), Italy (with Inter Milan), and Spain (with Real Madrid). While Jeb rued <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2012/06/jeb-bush-2012-was-my-time-to-run-077137" target="_blank">the missed opportunity</a> at a potentially impactful 2012 presidential run, José stewed over the fact that <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3301838/Cristiano-Ronaldo-nearly-came-blows-ex-boss-Jose-Mourinho-heated-exchange-Real-Madrid-dressing-room.html" target="_blank">he couldn’t corral the mega-ego</a> of Madrid’s Galactico-in-Chief, Cristiano Ronaldo. And the tactical nightmares of those El Clásico matches with Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona didn’t help matters much, either.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">If we fast forward to this week, it’s easy to see that Jeb’s political chutzpah and presidential campaign both appear to be in jeopardy and Jose’s managerial career arc has officially entered the “sabbatical” zone. Jeb’s political undoing came at the hands of a no-holds-barred verbal blitzkrieg from Donald J. Trump. José’s stewardship over the Chelsea capsizing came thanks to listless performances, unmotivated players, and haphazard decision-making, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3365236/Chelsea-set-pay-damages-former-doctor-public-row-Mourinho-led-downfall-club-fails-file-defence-employment-tribunal-deadline.html" target="_blank">like alienating (and firing)</a> the most important doctor from his club’s medical staff.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Both men are similar as much as they are different. For example, both are experts at assigning scorching, but petty nicknames to their biggest foes: Jeb Bush called Donald Trump “<a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/bush-boosts-trump-attacks-calling-rival-chaos-candidate-n481016" target="_blank">A Chaos Candidate</a>,” while José Mourinho has petulantly referred to Arsenal’s head honcho, Arsène Wenger, as a “<a href="http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/26188451" target="_blank">Specialist-in-Failure</a>.” Of course, all of that precious time and energy wasted on concocting these underwhelming nicknames hasn’t led to any tangible results. They just seem to bounce off of their intended targets without much harm, similar to the way the domineering Shaquille O’Neal dispatched  NBA point guards who unwittingly attacked the lane against him.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">All of this vengeful behavior from both Bush and Mourinho when they’re at their lowest lies in stark contrast to their sound game plan and strategy when they’re operating from the comforts of their categorically unrivaled highs. As the governor of Florida, Jeb focused on cutting government-funded programs and made it easier for privatization to occur within the state’s borders. During his first stint at Chelsea, José focused on creating a cohesive squad consisting of both English stars (Frank Lampard and John Terry) and international talent (Michael Ballack, Didier Drogba, and Claude Makélélé). Even though Wenger’s Arsenal and Sir Alex Ferguson’s Manchester United always posed substantial threats to Mourinho’s Chelsea, the manager was still able to leave West London with a few prestigious trophies in tow, thanks to his genius squad assembling and disarming tactical moves.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">During his tenure as Florida Governor, Jeb Bush successfully defunded the controversial Planned Parenthood program, outlining his vehement opposition to the government-backed initiative. During his short pit stop at Inter Milan, José Mourinho successfully defused the walking-talking volcano of emotions named Zlatan Ibrahimović, which is a significant accomplishment all on its own, given that both Louis van Gaal and Pep Guardiola failed to rein in the mercurial Swedish striker during his stints at Ajax and Barcelona, respectively.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But despite their ability to succeed at the highest of levels, both Bush and Mourinho eventually regressed back to the their respective means. And that regression ride wasn’t as pretty as their meteoric rise. Despite lavishly spending a cool <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/04/politics/jeb-bush-campaign-free-fall-3-percent/" target="_blank">$30 million in campaign ads</a>, Jeb is only polling at around 3% in most of the latest polls, per CNN. On the other hand, his chief adversary, Donald Trump, is lapping the field and running one of the strangest, polarizing, and (somehow) successful campaigns known to mankind.</p></div>

				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3365691/Jose-Mourinho-vs-Pep-Guardiola-II-Manchester-United-vs-Man-City.html" target="_blank">WWW.DAILYMAIL.CO.UK</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In Mourinho’s case, despite starting the 2015/16 Premier League season on the adulation of a league title, his Chelsea side only managed to muster up 15 points out of their first 16 league matches. His boorish behavior during press conferences and the cynical jabs at his fellow EPL managers didn’t help either side’s cause in the past few months. When Mourinho was given <a href="http://www.skysports.com/football/news/15116/10030436/why-was-jose-mourinho-charged-with-misconduct-by-the-fa" target="_blank">the stadium ban</a> by the FA, it even seemed as if the team played better away from the watchful eye of their manager, a telling sign that the ship’s crew were preparing for mutiny. Over time, as the negative results began to pile up, the unkind conclusion to Mourinho’s second Chelsea story seemed to will itself into a painful existence: An <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/18/sports/soccer/chelsea-fires-jose-mourinho.html" target="_blank">unceremonious parting</a> between the manager and club occurred on December 17, 2015.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Rest assured, José will find work in the upper echelons of football royalty in due time — Manchester United is already lining up a pitch that will bring “The Special One” to Old Trafford — and, accordingly, that’s not up for debate. But what is debatable is whether or not his impact with United will make up for the obvious baggage and controversy the Portuguese always seems to cook up no matter where he goes.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Then again, he <em>will</em> be potentially going to a place known as “The Theater of Dreams.” Let the drama unfold!</p></div>
