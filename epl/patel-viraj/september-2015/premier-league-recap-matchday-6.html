				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In a Premier League weekend that saw league leaders Manchester City falter to West Ham, United’s fantastic youngster Anthony Martial grab another two goals (that’s four goals in three matches now in all competitions), and Leicester City continue to carve out a spot in the upper echelons of the EPL table, I came away with one conclusion:</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Chelsea striker Diego Costa is a joker.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">No, not a practical joker like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FCBayernUS/videos/599848680158017/?pnref=story" target="_blank">the lovable goofball that is Thomas Müller</a> at Bayern Munich. Nor is he the walking, talking prankster that is former NBA big man and TV personality Shaquille O’Neal.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Simply put: Diego Costa is <b>the</b> Joker from Christopher Nolan’s celebrated 2008 film, <em>The Dark Knight</em>. Played to astonishing perfection by the late Heath Ledger, Nolan’s edition of the Joker featured a mascara wearing madman driven by an insatiable mission to “correct” — in the loosest interpretation of that word — all of society’s wrongs.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Of course, Chelsea’s star striker doesn’t gallivant around London causing havoc, but, on the soccer pitches, he’s the Joker through and through. While Costa doesn’t have the scary <em>"mommy got the kitchen knife to defend herself"</em> backstory that Ledger’s Joker had in the film, Diego, throughout his professional career, despite his preternatural talents in front of goal, has chosen to channel his inner <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKl11EzMTAE" target="_blank"><em>"come on, hit me, HIT ME!"</em></a> side of Ledger’s Joker more than we’d prefer.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><em>The Dark Knight</em>’s Joker engages in trickery, tomfoolery, and other extreme forms of stunning dilemmas to force Bruce Wayne’s hand throughout the film. Such can be also said of Señor Costa’s behavior as he strolled around the perfectly tapered Stamford Bridge pitch Saturday afternoon looking for an unsuspecting target (or two) of his next cleverly-laid ruse.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">After a rather exciting and open run of play in the opening 43 minutes of the Chelsea-Arsenal match at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, Diego Costa found himself in Arsenal’s penalty area being heavily defended by Laurent Koscielny. Looking to fire the first unwarranted shot in this mini Franco-Spanish War, the combative Costa decided to use his free hands to swipe across Koscielny’s face. To the Frenchman’s credit, despite the grievance, he simply moved on and continued playing.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“The rancor reignited moments later. As the ball was floated into the penalty area, Koscielny slightly caught Costa. The striker was furious, slamming his body into Koscielny and sending his opponent to the turf.”</p>
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Rob Harris, <em>NBC Sports</em>, <a href="http://scores.nbcsports.com/epl/recap.asp?g=2015091920025" target="_blank"><em>“2 sent off for Arsenal, Costa escapes red as Chelsea wins”</em></a></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Somehow, someway the referee on hand, Mike Dean, and his assistants were completely oblivious to Costa’s tactics and, in due time, they would be roped into his grand vision: To get an unsuspecting target riled up.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">After delivering the chest-bump that knocked Arsenal’s Koscielny to the ground, the Gunners’ second defender, Gabriel Paulista, got involved in order to retaliate on behalf of his fellow fallen defender. Big mistake.</p></div>
				
				<img src="sept-epl-images/diego-costa.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">IMAGE FROM <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3241159/Diego-Costa-Jose-Mourinho-s-reflection-pitch-Chelsea-just-like-Roy-Keane-Alex-Ferguson-s-Manchester-United.html" target="_blank"><em>REUTERS; THE DAILY MAIL</em></a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Like that suspenseful interrogation scene in <em>The Dark Knight</em> when the Joker snares the Batman to the prison while making him choose between saving himself or either Harvey Dent or Rachel Dawes, Costa, in typical Joker fashion, immediately made the unaware Gabriel (Batman) choose between saving himself (and his team) or standing up for a teammate (Koscielny). Ultimately, like Batman, Gabriel chose to selflessly fight for someone else and paid a high price for the act of graciousness.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">If you recall, in that film, while Bale’s Batman is off saving Dawes (on paper), Ledger’s Joker also conveniently engineers his escape from prison. Mr. Costa, despite now having clearly hit Koscielny and subsequently brought him to the ground, had not <em>yet</em> received a yellow card for his virulent actions.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Turning vigilante — when the proper authority fails you — comes at a personal cost. And, just like Bruce Wayne, Gabriel fell into Costa’s elaborate scheme to get the Brazilian defender sent off.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">After seeing the protracted verbal dispute occurring between Costa and Gabriel, some neurons actually fired in referee Mike Dean’s brain and instructed him to show the yellow to both the Spanish striker and the Brazilian defender. But, as per tradition, the Joker <em>always</em> gets the last laugh.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">So even after being warned with the yellow from the daft Dean, Costa continued to mouth off to Gabriel in what we can all assume were warm Portuguese pleasantries. Gabriel, evidently getting heated, lashed out by stepping on — and that’s putting it heavily — Costa’s feet, which gave the Blues’ Joker the requisite proof needed to plead his case with Mike Dean.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Of course, aside from the Chelsea fans — led by Mike Dean — and Gabriel, the rest of the viewing audience could easily smell the stink of Costa’s deliberate attempt to rile Gabriel up and get him to lash out instinctively. In a fit of frustration, Gabriel obliged, Costa pleaded, and Dean dished out the second yellow and the automatic red card to the Arsenal defender, giving Gabriel his marching orders just before half-time.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“This is a man [Costa] who in Spain was known for his expert pinching, and for one trick that involved, allegedly, spitting into his hand and then throwing it at his marker. Certainly Costa didn’t appear to be in control of his own emotions as he buffeted Koscielny around. A different ref might have sent him off then and there. At the same time his brilliantly attuned personal Geiger counter had detected a refereeing slackness, a space he could work in, and work it he did."</p>
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Barney Ronay, <em>The Guardian</em>, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/sep/19/chelsea-diego-costa-evidence-heist-arsenal" target="_blank"><em>“Chelsea’s Diego Costa leaves no evidence after the perfect heist”</em></a></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">After the fracas of the Costa-Paulista incident, the second-half began in earnest, however, from Arsenal’s standpoint, the damage was done the second the Gunners went down to ten men. Chelsea, sensing blood in the waters, immediately began playing with greater attacking intent than ever. And, in the 53rd-minute, Chelsea’s Kurt Zouma headed in the winning goal past Petr Čech from a well-taken Cesc Fàbregas free kick.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Arsène Wenger — who, in the Batman world, would have been perfectly casted as a brilliant mayor who simply refused to spend the money required to clean up his crime-ridden, corrupt city — could do no more than watch as his Gunners side struggled to adjust to the sprightly Chelsea attack. In the 78th-minute, Mike Dean continued to exhibit hapless and error-prone decision-making skills by unjustly showing Santi Cazorla his second yellow of the match, which locked away any and all chances of an Arsenal victory at a raucous Stamford Bridge.</p></div>
				
				<a href="https://twitter.com/__arsenalnews_/status/645687968540270596" target="_blank"><img src="sept-epl-images/arsenal-news-tweet.png" class="each_epl_image"></a>
				
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But the drama was not yet over since Eden Hazard decided to seal the Chelsea deal in the 90th-minute by slotting in the heavily-deflected effort from just outside the penalty area. While the late goal was a welcome sign for the reigning Premier League Player of the Year, the fact still stands that Hazard’s goal took a noticeable deflection off of Arsenal’s Calum Chambers and, therefore, it should have counted as an own-goal.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The game was a tough one to digest for Gunners fans in all corners of the world and it didn’t help that the refereeing mistakes displayed on Saturday all seemed to go against Arsenal. But that is football. You win some and you lose some. The important thing is to realize that there’s still 32 matches left to be played. Lots of time for Chelsea to slide back down to the lower recesses of the relegation zone. And more than enough time for Wenger to engineer Arsenal’s meteoric rise to an EPL title come May.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">While imagining all of that makes my heart swell, there’s one slight problem: We’ve gone through this entire recap without once bringing up the constant smugness that is Chelsea manager José Mourinho. After the match, reporters hounded the Portuguese in an attempt to get his thoughts on Diego Costa’s deleterious actions:</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">'I played against Arsenal 12, 15, 18 times, and only once he [Wenger] did not moan,’ Mourinho said. ‘On that day we lost the game, we lost the cup, it was not good for us. We behaved in a fantastic way.</p>
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">‘No excuses. Not crying. Not moaning. Just Mr. Jose Mourinho, my players and Chelsea football club.’</p>
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— José Mourinho, as quoted in <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3241290/Arsenal-boss-Arsene-Wenger-stop-crying-Chelsea-defeat-taunts-Jose-Mourinho.html" target="_blank"><em>The Daily Mail</em></a></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Hardly words of great comfort from the Premier League’s <a href="http://villains.wikia.com/wiki/Ra's_al_Ghul" target="_blank">Ra’s al Ghul</a>.</p></div>
