				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In world soccer, the best defensive midfielders are valuable assets for their teams. These types of players are workhorses who fade in and out of the run of play. However, they seldom attract the attention and adoration of the viewing audience since their play does not involve the Lionel Messi-type sinewy, slaloming runs past four or five defenders. Sure, they can pull off a sublime header or an unexpected dribble if need be, but, for the most part, these players ostensibly set up shop in front of their team’s defensive lines. In short, they link the offense to the defense and are usually the penultimate line of defense for their teams.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The position has been around since the start of football, however, in the late 90's and early 00's, Arsenal’s fiery Patrick Vieira and Chelsea’s tough Claude Makélélé made the position their own — in fact, the defensive midfielder position is commonly referred to as “the Makélélé role.” Their feats earned the duo some prestigious accolades as they paved the way for future defensive-minded footballers to be recognized on the world stage.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But, the pace of the games has noticeably quickened in recent years, which means the high-IQ, mistake-minimizing, tackle-machine-type, world-class defensive midfielders are highly sought-after bulwarks for the top teams. Moreover, in the 2014–2015 Premier League season, stats showed that teams predominantly <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/mar/13/louis-van-gaal-united-tinker-table-premier-league" target="_blank">deployed the 4–2–3–1 formation</a>, over all others, at the start of matches. This formation in particular fields two holding midfielders whose main responsibilities are to quell oncoming attacks from opponents and, once the threats have been neutralized, to quickly pass the ball to the awaiting wingers and attacking midfielders. This confection, when concocted efficiently by a defensive midfielder, immediately allows another attack on the opposing goal to initiate.</p></div>
				
				<img src="sept-epl-images/epl-formations.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">IMAGE FROM <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/mar/13/louis-van-gaal-united-tinker-table-premier-league" target="_blank"><em>THE GUARDIAN</em></a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">There are only a handful of these thoroughbred defensive-minded players in world soccer and this article ranks the very best talent — age 28 or younger — the sport has to offer. Why set an age restriction? Because studies across football have shown that <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-28254123" target="_blank">the average soccer player’s abilities peak around age 28</a>. Additionally, enforcing the age requirement helps us narrow the pool of highly-qualified candidates. While this means over-age stars like Phillip Lahm, Xabi Alonso, and Michael Carrick won’t appear on this list, we can take solace in the fact that those who <em>do</em> appear on the list — many of whom are about to hit the prime of their careers — are more than capable of inheriting the lofty honor when the time arrives.</p></div>		
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Finally, this ranking will only list players that spend a <em>majority</em> of their time <em>defending</em>. I mention this because at the end of the 2014–2015 European season, ESPN FC published their rankings of the world’s top defensive midfielders (no age restriction) and their listing contained players that are also the creative forces on their respective teams. Paul Pogba, Toni Kroos, Luke Modrić, and Yaya Touré are all players that are seen more as creating, attacking midfielders who, from time-to-time, help the team defensively. Yet, all four of these players erroneously appear on the ESPN FC list when they would have been better suited for the list ranking attacking midfielders. Hence, despite all of their otherworldly talents, attacking midfielders (who sometimes defend) like Pogba, Kroos, Modrić, and Touré have not been included on this list.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Without further ado, let’s rank the top ten defensive midfielders in world football that are aged 28 and under as of September 1st,  2015.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>10. Francis Coquelin (24) - Arsenal</b></p></div>
				
				<img src="sept-epl-images/francis-coquelin.png" class="each_epl_image_player_photo">
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In late-December 2014, the young Frenchman was recalled from his loan spell with Charlton Athletic by Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger to help fill up the injury-depleted Gunners squad. To Gunner Nation’s pleasant surprise, Coquelin put in a splendid performance as the team’s solo defensive midfielder in a December 28th, 2014 match against West Ham.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">From that point on, Coquelin went on to play in twenty-one more Premier League matches and earned plaudits from nearly all corners of the footballing world. An excellent athlete already, the Arsenal starlet succeeded in aerial challenges and his tackling and ball interception skills have been impressive ever since his first start for Arsenal. But, in recent times, the Gallic defensive midfielder has come under heavy scrutiny for <a href="http://www.espnfc.us/barclays-premier-league/23/blog/post/2580379/francis-coquelin-affects-arsenal-attacking-fluidity" target="_blank">negatively disrupting Arsenal’s overall balance of play</a> and his <a href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/premier-league-arsenal-arsene-wenger-francis-coquelin-defensive-midfield/" target="_blank">insignificance for the team offensively</a>. If Coquelin wishes to continue operating from the heart of the Arsenal defense for many more years to come, you’d expect him to make immense strides in the offensive aspects of his game.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>9. Marco Verratti (22)— PSG</b></p></div>
				
				<img src="sept-epl-images/marco-verratti.png" class="each_epl_image_player_photo">
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The Italian Verratti has slowly caught the attention of critics for his steady performances with Paris Saint-Germain. In a team that contains the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5BcVQyj7m0" target="_blank">defensively challenged, nutmeg-magnet David Luiz</a> at the heart of its defense, the twenty-two-year-old Verratti has shown that he can hold his own ground against some of the world’s finest opposition. Apparently, the rising PSG star has also indicated that he wants to take his talents elsewhere soon. If the rumors are true, then it’s evident that the 22-year-old phenom won’t come cheaply.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“Should the host of linked European superpowers be interested in the Italian international, £40 million to £50 million seems the more likely tag.”</p>
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Daniel Tiluk, <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2501808-why-marco-verratti-is-the-psg-player-with-most-to-prove-in-pre-season" target="_blank"><em>Bleacher Report</em></a></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>8. Luiz Gustavo (28) — VfL Wolfsburg</b></p></div>
				
				<img src="sept-epl-images/luiz-gustavo.png" class="each_epl_image_player_photo">
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Luiz Gustavo gets massively underrated in almost every subjective ranking conducted by the football media. Perhaps it’s because he was one of the many Brazilian players, led by the aforementioned David Luiz, who simply did not show up to play in the now infamous 7–1 semifinal beatdown in their home nation at the hands of the eventual 2014 FIFA World Cup winners Germany.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This is why, for this ranking, we turn to more objective measures: stats! After escaping the dark cloud of self-remorse and self-pity following the 7–1 shellacking, Gustavo actually had a great 2014–2015 Bundesliga season for VfL Wolfsburg. The Brazilian averaged 2.8 tackles, 3.1 interceptions, and 1.8 fouls per game in the 30 Bundesliga games he played. Those defensive statistics most certainly surpass the Bundesliga league average and, more importantly, show that Gustavo has performed excellently at Wolfsburg.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>7. Sami Khedira (28) — Juventus F.C.</b></p></div>
				
				<img src="sept-epl-images/sami-khedira.png" class="each_epl_image_player_photo">
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Sami Khedira captured all of the headlines during the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa when he formed the terrific triumvirate of rising young German stars with Mesut Özil and Thomas Müller. It would take four more years and yet another infusion of great German rising talents (Mats Hummels, Mario Götze, and André Schürrle) to lift the vaunted golden 2014 FIFA World Cup trophy in Brazil.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Khedira has been a solid defensive midfielder for the past five or six years and his years at Real Madrid (the club he joined — along with Özil — following the 2010 World Cup success) were supposed to propel him to the top. However, due to unfortunate injuries at untimely points in his career, the twenty-eight-year-old German has found himself having to prove his preternatural talents to European clubs. This summer, Khedira left the heart of Spain for the northern Italian city of Turin, which is the home of the Serie A champions Juventus. In Turin, he will be replacing living legend Andrea Pirlo (who now plays for NYCFC of the MLS), a feat that a player of Khedira’s talents can definitely accomplish, given he stays healthy for once.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>6. João Moutinho (28) — AS Monaco</b></p></div>
				
				<img src="sept-epl-images/joao-moutinho.png" class="each_epl_image_player_photo">
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The Portuguese international has been capped by his country 79 times already. He usually operates in the CDM role for both his club (AS Monaco) and country. Moutinho started his career at Sporting Lisbon in 2004 and gained recognition as a capable box-to-box midfielder. Soon enough, Portugal came calling when he was only 18-years-old and the star hasn’t looked back since.</p></div>		
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Possessing a sublime passing touch and a knack for timing his bone-crunching tackles, Moutinho has put in steady performances season-to-season. However, playing for the French side Monaco means Moutinho does not always benefit from the worldwide recognition that the his fellow star defensive midfielders across Europe gain as a direct byproduct of playing for a Manchester United or a Barcelona. But, despite this disadvantage, Moutinho has assembled an excellent career. A successful move to a top-tier team in England or Spain in the next year or so — the way Bayern Munich superstar Bastian Schweinsteiger did this summer when he packed his bags and left for Old Trafford — will provide the perfect cherry-on-top to an illustrious career.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>5. Blaise Matuidi (28) — PSG</b></p></div>
				
				<img src="sept-epl-images/blaise-matuidi.png" class="each_epl_image_player_photo">
				
				<div class="outside_quote">
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“Matuidi is one of those players who can often go unnoticed when his team is playing well. He performs his defensive duties excellently, while also contributing towards the attack without ever looking too prominent.</p>
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">That, in part, perhaps explains why he is one of the most underrated players in European football at present.”</p>
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Jonathan Johnson, <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2093456-why-blaise-matuidi-will-be-frances-surprise-weapon-at-the-world-cup" target="_blank"><em>Bleacher Report</em></a></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Before the 2014 World Cup began in Brazil, Blaise Matuidi was already being touted as <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2093456-why-blaise-matuidi-will-be-frances-surprise-weapon-at-the-world-cup" target="_blank">“France’s secret weapon.”</a> By the time <em>les Bleus</em> were eliminated in the quarterfinals by eventual champions Germany, it was evident that Matuidi has given his all for his beloved France. He started all five of the World Cup games that France played in Brazil and his stamina did not waver throughout the long 2014–2015 Ligue 1 campaign for Paris Saint-Germain.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Like Marco Verratti, Matuidi had to simultaneously help link up the defense and offense while constantly keeping a watchful eye on the “accident-waiting-to-happen” that is David Luiz. That alone should have put his name near the top of any “top defensive midfielders” ranking.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>4. Morgan Schneiderlin (25) — Manchester United</b></p></div>
				
				<img src="sept-epl-images/morgan-schneiderlin.png" class="each_epl_image_player_photo">
				
				<div class="outside_quote">
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“And different still is Southampton’s one-man dynamo, Morgan Schneiderlin. The Frenchman is an absolute superstar of a defensive pressing midfielder. He led all midfielders in tackles attempted, tackles won, and interceptions, with the fourth-highest percentage of tackles won of any midfielder who had attempted more than 125. He is a game-changing defensive force, and Pochettino setting him loose on the EPL was the single best decision the manager made.”</p>
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Mike L. Goodman, <a href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/under-pressure-why-does-the-premier-league-play-so-fast/" target="_blank"><em>Grantland</em> (in a August 2013 article)</a></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Mike L. Goodman’s raving review of the newly-minted Manchester United star Morgan Schneiderlin back in 2013 only laid the foundation upon which the former Southampton man went about building his reputation as one of the best young defensive midfielders in Europe. Upon his arrival at “The Theatre of Dreams” this summer, manager Louis van Gaal immediately slotted him into a defensive partnership with Michael Carrick and Bastian Schweinsteiger. Schneiderlin has featured in all five of United’s Premier League matches and has been the impetus shepherding the usually formidable Red Devil defense and midfield.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In the 2014–2015 Premier League season, United’s downfall was its porous defense, which was highly capable of letting in late goals via haphazard, frantic defending. This season, the arrival of Schneiderlin has helped the center defense pairing of Chris Smalling and Daley Blind focus solely on their own defensive duties during crunch time with a relative peace-of-mind knowing that the reliable Schneiderlin will stave off the most potent of opposing attacks.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>3. Arturo Vidal (28) — Bayern Munich</b></p></div>
				
				<img src="sept-epl-images/arturo-vidal.png" class="each_epl_image_player_photo">
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This summer Arturo Vidal <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2015/06/17/football/arturo-vidal-crash-chile-football/" target="_blank">ran into some trouble with the law</a> in his home nation of Chile, which ended up alerting the local police. But, on matchdays, Señor Vidal is the one found policing the opposing attacks and shepherding his own team’s defense. Thanks, in part, to the midfield quartet of Vidal, Paul Pogba, Andrea Pirlo, and Claudio Marchissio, Juventus was able to easily win the Serie A and the Coppa Italia last season. They also came just shy of the Champions League title against Barcelona in early June 2015.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This summer, the star Juve man made the move to Germany’s most dominant team, Bayern Munich. Bavaria’s lifestyle seems to have suited the Chilean well since his arrival and this is evidenced by his work rate and tenacity in helping Bayern preserve a perfect record after four matches.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>2. Sergio Busquets (27) — FC Barcelona</b></p></div>
				
				<img src="sept-epl-images/sergio-busquets.png" class="each_epl_image_player_photo">
				
				<div class="outside_quote">
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“You watch the game, you don’t see Busquets. You watch Busquets, you see the whole game.”</p>
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Vincente Del Bosque, Spanish National Team Manager</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Essentially, what Del Bosque is attempting to insinuate is that over the course of a Barcelona soccer match, it is easy to forget that Sergio Busquets is playing in the match. But, if you focus only on Sergio Busquets for the whole match, you come away appreciating all of the little things he does so superbly for Barcelona. His calm and composed nature, combined with his remarkable vision and passing accuracy, has been an absolute boon for Barcelona.</p></div>
				
				<div class="video_container"><iframe class="youtube_video" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/fJB90-Ww_ms" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The Catalans usually field a 4–3–3 formation and, in that midfield three, Busquets is the only defensive-minded midfielder. As such, he is the sole link between the defense and the high-powered offense that features superstars like Lionel Messi, Luis Suárez, and Neymar. Without Busquets, Barcelona suffer in their matches and the offense-defense link remains weakened until Busquets enters the fray to reinforce it.</p></div>		
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Additionally, since Barcelona’s left back Jordi Alba and right back Dani Alves are constantly surging forwards, on unexpected, sudden counterattacks, the prime defensive responsibilities always end up falling to Sergio Busquets, Gerard Piqué, and Javier Mascherano. Without these three players sealing the Barcelona defensive holes airtight match-to-match, the team would most assuredly fall short of its lofty goals.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>1. Nemanja Matić (27) — Chelsea F.C.</b></p></div>
				
				<img src="sept-epl-images/nemanja-matic.png" class="each_epl_image_player_photo">
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The Serbian has easily been José Mourinho’s best signing thus far. Both player and manager are in their second stints at Chelsea F.C. having been shown the exit once before. In January 2011, Matić was swapped from Chelsea to Benfica in a deal that brought David “he only nutmegged me twice” Luiz to Stamford Bridge. Then, in the January transfer window of the 2013–2014 Premier League season, José Mourinho brought back Matić for  £22 million.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In the intervening time frame, Nemanja Matić has easily become the best defensive midfielder in the world, bar none. Ever ready to either launch into a perfectly timed challenge or to offer one of his pinpoint passes, the Chelsea star has quickly settled with life at Stamford Bridge once again.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This Premier League season, despite Chelsea’s thoroughly lackadaisical performances and stagnant attacking force, Matić stands out as one of the few players still performing decently. Of course, due to Chelsea’s inefficiencies and many mistakes, even Matić has been blamed for some of the jarring blunders that the Blues have readily committed during EPL matches. If Chelsea are to reprise their role as Premier League Champions once again, then its all but guaranteed that Matić will play one of the leading roles in the revival.</p></div>
				
				<hr class="contributors_hr">
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">It’s virtually undeniable: Every single player on this list is a star in the making. Many are already superstars. Yet they are not always perceived that way by the average football fan. Nemanja Matić or Sergio Busquets can make all of the key tackles in a pivotal match against a rival like Manchester United or Real Madrid, but the Messis and the Ronaldos of the footballing world will still capture all of the post-match media attention. That’s simply life as a defensive midfielder.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Accordingly, playing defensive midfield for a top-tier football club can be a thankless task and most of these guys are massively under-appreciated by the average fan. The great Zinedine Zidane once said of his departing Real Madrid colleague Claude Makélélé, whom Real was replacing with Manchester United and global icon David Beckham, “Why put another layer of gold paint on the Bentley when you are losing the entire engine?”</p></div>
							
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">To Zidane, Mr. Beckham, for all his abilities, was simply another coating of paint on a team that would now be missing its heart and soul in Makélélé, who was departing for Chelsea that year.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The only remaining question: Why <em>wouldn’t</em> you do everything in your power as a manager, club, and fan base to acquire one or more of these all-important engines for your football club?</p></div>
