				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">It’s that time of the year again, folks. That time in the Premier League season when winter gives way to the Ides of March. More recently (and importantly), this is the general time frame when Arsenal squander our lofty expectations of them by simultaneously blowing themselves out of the Premier League title race and exiting the Champions League in the round of 16. But at least for the past two seasons, exiting the FA Cup right about now didn’t make Arsenal’s priority list, as Arsène Wenger’s side made headway in collecting the last two FA Cup titles. All good things come to an end, however, and this season, Arsenal added (or re-added) the FA Cup exit back into their evergreen list of piling disappointments.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">It is a feeling all too familiar among the Gunners faithful. It’s been so long since they’ve won a major title - sorry, but the FA Cup, however glorified, is not a major title - that some have adopted a cynical attitude (including me) towards their campaign every year. It’s not surprising then that their main sponsor, Emirates Airline, somehow felt the same way, too. Feeling disappointed that is. The Dubai-based airline has sponsored the North London stadium that Arsenal played in on Sunday, including Arsenal’s memorable kits. And starting this season, upon sensing the Gunners’ realistic hunger for a third straight FA Cup, they decided to sponsor the Cup itself, christening “The Emirates FA Cup” into existence. Given all of this lavish spending from Dubai, you’d think that North London’s finest club would at least attempt to do right by their major sponsor.</p></div>
				
				<img src="mar-epl-article-images/emirates-stadium.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="http://www.pixelstalk.net/arsenal-emirates-stadium-wallpaper-hd/" target="_blank">WWW.PIXELSTALK.NET</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">I’d imagine the executives in the Emirates hierarchy are actually re-thinking their approach regarding sponsorship right about now. We are talking about a company that has a major presence across all five major leagues in Europe. The “Fly Emirates” emblem is emblazoned upon the likes of Real Madrid in Spain, Paris St. Germain in France, AC Milan in Italy, Hamburg in Germany, and, of course, Arsenal in England. Add to that star-studded lineup a <a href="http://www.espnfc.us/portuguese-liga/14/table" target="_blank">league-leading</a> Benfica (based out of Portugal) and we have a brand hell-bent on European domination.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Having a pervasive presence throughout Europe is one thing, but a <em>successful</em> presence? In a sporting sense, Emirates Airlines, unlike their world-class jets, hasn’t touched the high skies. If you leave out Real Madrid and Paris St. Germain (who, by the way, <a href="http://www.goal.com/en/news/1722/ligue-1/2016/03/13/21275552/paris-saint-germain-are-ligue-1s-most-dominant-side-ever-but-not-?ICID=TP_NL_6" target="_blank">won 9-0 against Troyes</a> this past weekend, sealing the fastest ever title win in any of Europe’s five major leagues) and to an extent, Benfica, the remaining cadre of simmering disappointments don’t help the cause: AC Milan’s sixth in Serie A, Hamburg is twelfth in the Bundesliga, and Arsenal? Well, you know how that’s turning out. Out of all the clubs, only Arsenal have the benefit of having their stadium name (originally known as Ashburton Grove before the Emirates millions intervened) sponsored by the airline.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“You know this season for example, he has had game where he has gone boom, boom, boom, boom, boom and after he had a little spell where he didn’t score. Now I hope he has a repetition of his former spell and starts to score again.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">—  Arsène Wenger, talking to reporters in his pre-match press conference about his main striker, Olivier Giroud</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The above remarks were delivered by Wenger while assuming that Giroud would be on form once again after scoring a brace in last Tuesday’s 4-0 jettisoning of Hull City. Oh, but if only it were that easy. Giroud immediately came crashing to planet Earth on Sunday afternoon against Quique Sánchez Flores’s upstart Watford side. Looking somewhat lost at times in the midst of the Hornets central defensive pairing of Sebastian Prödl and Craig Cathcart, he failed to provide the crucial focal point of Arsenal’s attack. A battering ram he is not, despite his build. Watford’s effective defensive scheme ensured that his attacking counterparts also failed in unlocking a stubborn defense.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">It is in this match that Arsenal proved themselves flawed, as the slaloming runs of Aaron Ramsey from midfield fizzled out due to a lack of support. As much as Mohamed Elneny is effective in retaining and recycling the ball, he is no Ramsey when on the attack. The two shots that he skied from the most enviable of positions would’ve been on target (or even a goal at the very least) on the twinkle-toed feet of Ramsey. Overeagerness to impress might be the reason for Elneny’s harrowing misses, so I’m going to give him the benefit of the doubt for now. Besides, if utilized in a more defensive manner, just as he was back in Basel, there’s no doubt he would do a much better job, perhaps even better than his French midfield counterpart, Francis Coquelin.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“It was difficult to understand how we didn’t score. I want to watch it again. It was a typical cup game against a team who comes here to fight and take their chances, with us trying to score. It was just like that, there’s not a lot more to say.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">—  Arsène Wenger, discussing Danny Welbeck’s stunning miss in the post-match press conference</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">I hope Welbeck doesn’t get fried for his miss in the dying minutes, because he caused way too much havoc in the Hornets’ backline in only 20 minutes of pitch time than Giroud ever did in a full hour. Plus, Welbeck’s the one who pulled one back, courtesy of a genius backheel assist by the King of Assists himself, Mesut Özil. Could he have scored? Yes, if he hadn’t twisted himself instead of just tapping in the rebound off of Alex Iwobi’s shot that hit the post. Even after taking into account Ben Watson’s defensive pressure glaring at him, a tap-in still remains Welbeck’s best option. But despite the golden opportunity he squandered, Welbeck is not the cause of Arsenal’s downfall in this match.</p></div>
				
				<img src="mar-epl-article-images/watford.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="https://www.facebook.com/TheFACup/photos/a.176366626501.134439.138819296501/10153317676281502/" target="_blank">THE FA EMIRATES CUP FACEBOOK ACCOUNT</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Rather it’s the sense of urgency and, somewhat surprisingly, naivety that caused Arsenal to fall. Surely the defensive pairing of Mertesacker and Gabriel knew the danger posed by Watford’s dynamic duo of Troy Deeney and Odion Ighalo. Surely Wenger should have reminded the rest of the squad how important the FA Cup is, with the club already staring down the barrel against Barcelona in the Champions League and looking set to finish humiliatingly below Spurs in the Premier League.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“We want to make the impossible possible [in Barcelona] and we know we play against a very strong, strong side and it’s important that we go there and focus and show a very good response.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">—  Arsène Wenger, casting light on his club’s prospects against Barcelona this week</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">They better be gearing for a “good response.” Otherwise, they will be on the receiving end of an almighty hammering at the Camp Nou. For the record, Barcelona warmed up for the upcoming fixture with a oh-so-sweet 6-0 victory over Getafe in La Liga over the weekend. Did I mention Luis <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3460345/Luis-Suarez-left-passport-home-flying-London-Barcelona-team-mates-Arsenal-Champions-League-clash.html" target="_blank">“I forgot my passport”</a> Suárez wasn’t even playing? Not that it matters. Nowadays, even if Barcelona is down to only one member of the MSN trident playing, they are still more than capable of inflicting a beating of gigantic proportions.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Maybe that is what Arsenal needs right now. A beatdown so severe and savage that it rattles the very foundation of Arsenal as a football club. Perhaps what Wenger said will come true, that Arsenal will make the impossible possible at Camp Nou...starting with he himself getting fired and replaced on an interim basis by Mathieu “Spurs Killer” Flamini for the rest of the season. Then, Arsenal implode and end up finishing below Chelsea by the league’s end. Emirates quickly fly back to West London and re-become the sponsor for Chelsea. Arsenal’s 2016-17 campaign begins with no fanfare and no fans in that state-of-the-art “(High)Rates Stadium.” And with all these failings pummeling the club to the ground, the owner Stan Kroenke will finally decide to move Arsenal to Los Angeles, and rename the club the Los Angeles Gunners, who immediately begin competing in the Western Conference of Major League Soccer.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">WHOA….what just happened?!?! Must’ve fell asleep at my laptop. My gosh, what a nightmare.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But one sobering fact remains: Even in my dreams Arsenal find a way to fulfill the worst-case scenario.</p></div>
