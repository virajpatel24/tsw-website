				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Oh, what could have been. Buoyed by their advance into the Europa League’s quarterfinals (made possible via a resounding victory over archrival Manchester United), Liverpool started off brightly at St. Mary’s Park this past Sunday afternoon. Leading up to the match, the Merseyside club’s faithful even felt that an encore of the 6-1 mauling inflicted on Southampton back in December would come to pass once more. Southampton themselves would’ve been forgiven if they thought the same, too. The two goals scored by Philippe Coutinho and Daniel Sturridge, coupled with those marvellously sharp counterattacks, were ominous signs for the Saints heading into the halftime break.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But that’s where the wispy dreams ended for Liverpool. What happened after the break was an unmitigated catastrophe for the Reds. Whatever cohesion and organization they had possessed in the first half instantly vanished in the second half. Southampton, somewhat inspired by whatever their manager Ronald Koeman said to them during the break, signalled their malicious intent to fight back as they went for the win on their home turf. Koeman’s men seemed to transform into 11 men fueled by one overarching goal: To not succumb to a huge defeat, especially at their home.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">So, while Koeman introduced his stars, like Sadio Mané and Victor Wanyama, Jürgen Klopp opted to introduce Martin Škrtel in place of the overly-aggressive Dejan Lovren. Klopp’s decision may have seemed somewhat logical and safe at the time considering Lovren was already on thin ice due to his persistent tussles with Shane Long. It could’ve been worse for the Croatian had his blatant push on Long in the penalty box been punished by the referee, Roger East. But surprisingly, the match official decided to overlook that incident - not that it changed the final outcome in any way.</p></div>

				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="https://www.facebook.com/LiverpoolFC/photos/a.100998577572.107684.67920382572/10154174311237573/" target="_blank">LIVERPOOL FC FACEBOOK ACCOUNT</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">You can only control what you can control and, as a result, Koeman sent out his side in a positive state of mind coming out of halftime. Tactically, Victor Wanyama became the immense wall in midfield that Liverpool’s Joe Allen and Emre Can couldn’t get past. Meanwhile, Sadio Mané bamboozled the Reds’ defense left, right, and center. Graziano Pellè, who was marshalled proficiently by the Reds defense in the first half, finally broke his shackles and came to life in the second.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Škrtel’s tug on Pellè in the visitor’s penalty box didn’t go unpunished by Mr. East, who was hellbent on making up for the officiating mistake that he had made in the first half. While Mané was unable to convert, it was a sign of things to come as Southampton relentlessly pursued their objective: Nab the comeback victory. Mistakes made by the increasingly error-strewn passing of the Liverpool backline and midfield were severely punished by the Saints’ clinical attack, resulting in a final scoreline of 3-2, which sealed the well-deserved victory for Southampton.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“We needed to show the belief and the spirit in coming back into the game and to make it 2-1, because then, it would be a really open game. That happened. We showed a great spirit. A great second half. The substitutes, Sadio and Victor, had a big impact in the game in the second half. It was well deserved, a great game. This is what football is about. I'm proud of the team and the fans. It's easy to tell everybody because you get the full three points, but even with the 2-2 or the 2-1, how we came back in the game was amazing. At 2-0 down against Liverpool, they let us live, the reaction of the players and winning the game makes it special. I'm very proud of the team. It was a must win game. We are still fighting for a European place, that is what we want.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">—  Ronald Koeman, talking to the press after the match</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">It was indeed a happy occasion for Mr. Koeman, with his birthday coming up and all. But what impacted me the most from his words were his ambition and objectivity. Notice that amidst all the happy and motivational comments, the Dutchman let slip the main objective of his team: To qualify for Europe and fight for that right over these remaining seven league games.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The Sunday victory over Liverpool ensured that Southampton, now seventh in the EPL table, separated themselves from the visitors by three full points while also making up some ground on West Ham (fifth) and Manchester United (sixth). What is even more fascinating is that the Saints are only four points away from fourth-placed Manchester City, who are the current occupiers of the final Champions League qualification spot. While that may be a bridge too far for the Saints to cross, the Europa League spots remain a definite possibility. Victory over a direct rival, like Liverpool, is certainly going to be beneficial in this fiercely-contested European qualification battle.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Liverpool are, of course, in the quarterfinals of the Europa League, but just look at who they’ll be facing: Jurgen Klopp’s former club, Borussia Dortmund. Thomas Tuchel presides over one of Europe’s elite clubs in Borussia Dortmund. Even England’s second-best team this season, Tottenham Hotspur, can’t hold a candle to them. What chance do Liverpool have, if their performance against Southampton is any indication? Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Marco Reus, Mats Hummels, and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang will be licking their lips at the prospect of tearing down their ex-boss’s team. Hence, it is quite important that Mr. Klopp ensures that his team doesn’t lose sight of the slightly “easier” route to securing a Champions League spot that’s there for Liverpool’s taking in the Premier League.</p></div>
				
				<img src="mar-epl-article-images/klopp.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="https://www.facebook.com/LiverpoolFC/photos/a.100998577572.107684.67920382572/10154174082812573/" target="_blank">LIVERPOOL FC FACEBOOK ACCOUNT</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">European football plays a very important role, especially for a club of Liverpool’s stature. It is imperative that they participate for the sake of their history and their ever-loyal fans. But, of course, the resulting money and prestige are always nice to have, too. Talented Liverpool players, like Philippe Coutinho, Roberto Firmino, and Emre Can, will surely be enticed by newer pastures if their club fails in this regard. At the present time, any departures seem highly unlikely, seeing that Jürgen Klopp is only getting started. Setting a baseline of at least playing in the Europa League next season is crucial for whatever the German manager has planned for the upcoming season.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“There are still 27 points for us to get from nine games? If we can get all of them, there’s a chance, if not it’s difficult. It is difficult and we don’t have to dream of things like this – we have to play football and win games. If we play like we did in the first half, we can win games.If we play like we did in the second half, it’s a little bit more difficult.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">—  Jürgen Klopp, addressing the press after the match</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Perhaps spurred by the Saints’ comeback and a healthy dose of some “never-say-die” attitude, the German gaffer appeared undeterred post-match. Aspiring to remain undefeated for the remainder of the campaign is no small feat to achieve, considering that the club still has to welcome Tottenham, Everton, and Chelsea to Anfield. But it is an ambition nonetheless, something that his charges can look to instill in themselves. That being said, it’s not game over yet by any measure. Just like a match isn’t over till the referee blows his final whistle, the season isn’t over till the very last match. Just ask Manchester City, a club that has won the Premiership title twice already by holding on to this kind of ambitious belief till the last possible second.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">While Liverpool won’t be fighting for the Premier League title this season, the concept of not giving up remains the same. There’s no doubt that the team can play up to their manager’s ethos of fanatical <em>geggenpressing</em>, as evidenced in their first-half display at St. Mary’s Park. It is simply consistency that they need to rectify, not just in terms of sustaining the performance across the whole 90 minutes, but in terms of the players individually as well. Thankfully, there’s still time to address any lingering chinks in their armor, with the international break coming at the most opportune of times this week. Hopefully, for the Reds’ sake, they’ll manage to address the cabal of issues successfully. If they fail to do so, then calamity just may continue to ensue as the title-chasing Tottenham Hotspur await them when Premier League action resumes on Saturday, April 2. Good luck trying to unlock the league’s stingiest defense come April 2nd, Mr. Klopp!</p></div>
