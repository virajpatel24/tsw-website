				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Injuries during a pivotal moment of the season can derail a club’s championship aspirations. Even more so when the manager at the helm is under severe pressure to deliver performances fitting of a “big club.” Murphy’s Law is certainly applicable regarding the situation at Old Trafford. But Manchester United somehow stayed above the law, and it appears that their opponents - in this case, Arsenal - are the ones who are embracing it. <em>Anything that can go wrong will go wrong</em>, and this is especially true for the Gunners. Funny how the law could have applied for the Red Devils, too, after harrowing defeats against Sunderland in the Premier League and FC Midtjylland in their first-leg Europa League encounter.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Oh, how things have changed in the course of a fortnight. United turned around their fortunes in the Europa League with a 5-1 drubbing of Midtjylland in the second leg, and they calmly followed that up with a very convincing 3-2 victory over Arsenal at Old Trafford this past Sunday. Don’t be fooled by the 3-2 scoreline just because it looks close, the match was anything but. In the absence of stars, like Wayne Rooney, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Anthony Martial, Chris Smalling, and various other important members of the first team, the man of the moment, Marcus Rashford, entered the fray. Well, not quite a “man” yet, considering he’s only 18 years old.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Yet, it is this teenage debutant that enabled Manchester United to turn around their fortunes. The call for United players to be on their “A-Games” was definitely answered, and who better to answer the call of urgent excellence than a teenager? Braces in successive crucial matches speaks volumes of Rashford’s immense talent and abilities. In fact, his performances have already graced the record books. He is now <a href="http://www.goal.com/en/news/1862/premier-league/2016/02/28/20804312/rashford-breaks-another-record-for-manchester-united" target="_blank">the youngest player ever to score for United in a European competition</a> since George Best in 1964 and also the youngest player ever to score for United in his first match in the Premier League since James Wilson against Hull in May 2014. He also <a href="http://www.goal.com/en/news/1862/premier-league/2016/02/28/20813112/rashford-rooneys-incredible-fact" target="_blank">matched Wayne Rooney’s record</a> of scoring their first ever Premier League double at the age of 18 years and 120 days. And if that wasn’t enough, check out the glowing assessment given by one of the greatest Premier League strikers in history and the “king” of Arsenal, Thierry Henry.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“What I like about him, obviously he’s scored four goals in two games, is his movement, the way he holds the ball, there’s desire there. His awareness, he’s in the box, calm. His positioning is good, good header, on target. But he’s also doing the dirty jobs. It’s not only about the goals, holding the ball, awareness. Only he can now answer if he can carry on or not, but I love his all-round game.”</p>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Louis van Gaal’s Oscar-worthy theatrics on the sideline at Old Trafford might have been blamed on emotions and Alexis Sánchez’s perceived dive, but deep down in his own consciousness, it could be the reaction to what he’s experiencing at the moment. Who would’ve thought that at a very crucial moment, United’s lackluster 2015-16 campaign was saved somewhat by a certain Marcus Rashford, a sprightly teenager plucked from the academy to cover for the lengthy injury enforced absence of first team players. And it’s not just Rashford, other academy products have been given the chance to showcase their talent on the biggest stage of them all, too.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Much has been made about the state of Manchester United’s academy falling from grace these past few months, surpassed by their neighbors in blue even. The so-called evolution of United as a club into that of Real Madrid’s stature - buying superstars instead of nurturing them from the academy - was envisioned by their executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward. Yet, when push came to shove and the injury list mounted, it was the academy that is doing the saving of United’s bacon on the field. Just this season alone, we have witnessed youngsters like Guillermo Varela, Cameron Borthwick-Jackson, Andreas Pereira, and Donald Love (no relation to Kevin Love, of the NBA’s Cleveland Cavaliers) make their debuts. And in the match against Arsenal, the aforementioned Marcus Rashford, Timothy Fosu-Mensah, and James Weir made their thundering appearances.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This all points to an academy brimming with talent, just waiting to be given a chance to break into the first team, but not given the confidence and opportunities to do so by the higher-ups. To quote the former United States President Jimmy Carter, it is a “crisis of confidence.” It is a crisis that strikes at the very heart, soul, and spirit of Manchester United. In this case, the crisis is buttressed by the higher-ups’ lack of confidence in the academy, an institution that once produced the class of ‘92, which consists of names like Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, David Beckham, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, and Nicky Butt. It is only now - with injuries mounting - that the youngsters are given a chance, and so far, they’re proving themselves more than capable.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">With all these precocious talents stepping up to the plate as of late for Manchester United, one might wonder...why all the spending so far in the post-Ferguson era? To answer that, you need to look at the man pulling the strings at Old Trafford, Ed Woodward. He wields the most power off the field and he is, of course, the pillar of strength behind the polarizing Louis van Gaal. His vision of United replicating Real Madrid is flawed at best. “Flawed” because that vision goes against the very principle of United as an institution, which is to develop their own talents. The Red Devils don’t buy ready-made stars, they buy young and develop them, coupled with the strength of players emerging from the academy. Even superstars, like Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney, were bought at an early age and carefully developed under Sir Alex’s guidance. Recent developments have noted that the owners of Manchester United (the Glazers) are trying to whittle down Woodward’s power at the club. Separation of duties are in effect, with Woodward focusing on the business side of things (an area in which he excels at) and someone else to focus on the football side. These goals may result in the creation of the “Director of Football” role at United in the near future, if <em><a href="http://www.goal.com/en/news/11/transfer-zone/2016/02/28/20796482/rumours-man-utd-to-appoint-director-of-football-to-arrest" target="_blank">The Sunday Times</a></em> are to be believed.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The appointment of a new manager to replace van Gaal is also of utmost importance. However, if rumors of Jose Mourinho taking over the hot seat are true, then everything would have been for nought. Mourinho, for all his success in winning titles, is not particularly known to give young players a chance, preferring to buy proven commodities instead. Players with immense potential, like Marcus Rashford, may find first team appearances hard to come by. And if that is any indication, what chance do the other young players have? Still, that is something that is uncertain in the future. For now, lets just enjoy the rare appearances afforded to the young devils and their exploits. Who knows, we might be witnessing the next class of exceptional players playing for United. Class of ‘16 anyone?</p></div>
