				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">When I want to play a virtual football game, it’s always a choice between the EA Sports <em>FIFA</em> juggernaut or the <em>Pro Evolution Soccer</em> series from Konami. If it’s a manager simulation that I want, well, there’s only one choice on the market right now: Sports Interactive’s <em>Football Manager</em> series. All three franchises have been mainstays throughout my gaming life, and without delving deeper into the argument of which product is the best, let me just say that I enjoy playing every single one of them to this very day.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Even with my hands (and attention span) full playing all three games, sometimes I still wonder about other options. The current era doesn’t really provide many options, with the aforementioned three games being the only ones available, if a high-quality gaming experience is your goal. So, when reading up on the hot topic circulating around the world of football right now - the impending creation of a European “Super” League - I stumbled upon this rare game, by the same name, when I was searching for a logo of sorts. However, not much is known about the game, other than the fact that it was released on the Dreamcast platform, too. Basically, that can only mean that the game is really, really bad. Or, as Charles Barkley likes to say, in all likelihood, the gaming experience was probably “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hIqesIVX-c" target="_blank">turrible</a>.”</p></div>

				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="http://s.emuparadise.org/DC-PAL-Covers/European%20Super%20League%20PAL%20DC-front.jpg" target="_blank">WWW.S.EMUPARADISE.ORG</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">“Ridiculous” can also be used to describe the alleged discussions that took place at the famed Dorchester Hotel in London regarding the possible formation of a European “Super” League. What made it even more ridiculous were the parties assembled in the meeting, the so-called “Big Five” of the English Premier League. Consisting of Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United, Liverpool, and Leicester. Oh, wait. I’m being told it was Chelsea who was invited instead of Leicester. So much for the “Super” in this cockamamie European Super League idea.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The “Big Five” can’t even make the grade now in the Premier League, let alone in the UEFA Champions League. The fact that this meeting was facilitated by an American (Charlie Stillitano) who only desires for more money, profit, and fame pushed this whole situation beyond ridiculousness.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“What would Manchester United argue? Did we create soccer or did Leicester create it? Let’s call it the money pot created by soccer and the fandom around the world. Who has had more of an integral role, Manchester United or Leicester? It’s a wonderful, wonderful story, but you could see it from Manchester United’s point of view too. Maybe that [Leicester being in the Champions League] is absolutely spectacular unless you are a Manchester United fan, Liverpool fan… or a Chelsea fan.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">—  Charlie Stillitano, chairman of Relevent Sports</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Oh, the words of an elitist. Stillitano is, of course, the bald-headed man hellbent on making the European Super League idea into a reality. But ardent football fans refer to him as “the man who will destroy football as we know it.” His words are like insults to fans all across the globe, particularly those who are not “wealthy” or “filthy rich.” Here’s the underlying subtext: <em>We, the “Big Five,” are super rich and are, therefore, more deserving and entitled of our impending participation in this supposed “Super” League...even though one of you (Leicester) has the talent to be a part of this elite group, and created a wonderful rags-to-riches story, we have the fame that you don’t. Hence, good luck in that wasteland that will be known as the UEFA Champions League in a couple of years!</em></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Getting back on track, the notion of fair competition and getting to the top on merit is somehow alien to this American. Here’s more from him the Bald Eagle himself:</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“This is going to sound arrogant and it’s the furthest thing from it… but suddenly when you see the teams we have this summer in the ICC (International Champions Cup) you are going to shake your head and say, ‘Isn’t that the Champions League?’ No, the Champions League is PSV and Gent.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">—  Charlie Stillitano, once again airing those elitist thoughts of his</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Okay, first off, that is arrogant, it is simply is. Secondly, what is wrong with PSV and Gent? They were both champions of their respective leagues (the Dutch Eredivisie and the Belgian Super League) last season, that’s why they qualified for the “Champion’s League” in the first place. If anything, they did the competition a huge favor by quickly dispatching the actual non-champions in the group stages (PSV eliminated Louis van Gaal’s faltering Manchester United and Gent went on to ship off both Valencia and Lyon).</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The fact that United, one of the “Big Five” attending the European Super League meeting, was eliminated early on in this year’s Champion’s League, coupled with the fact that they are currently being overshadowed every single weekend in the Premier League by the likes of Leicester, Tottenham, and West Ham, has compounded their need of a guaranteed place in Europe’s elite moving forward. If a club like United is indeed “elite,” then they should have no problem competing in Europe’s most prestigious tournament. Instead, they are now disappointing more often than not each time out. Even while taking into account the freakish nature of the Premier League this season, shouldn’t they be even more fired up to improve their performances next season and show everyone just how elite they are? It’s a better method than just politicking their way to a seat at the privileged table like a spoiled brat while crying endlessly about how unfair everything has become for them.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Another point of contention in having to entertain this sort of controversial notion is the imminent re-negotiation of the UEFA Champions League T.V. contract. To put it in more simple terms, it’s all about the money. Even if the contract is considerably upgraded in monetary terms, it will still fall way short from what the English Premier League is earning. To put it into perspective, a team that wins the Champions League will stand to earn a paltry 80 million euros compared to a team that finishes dead last in the Premier League, which will earn a whopping 125 million euros. Of course, these are approximate figures, but the point is, this is the sort of financial gulf that envelops teams all across Europe. And somehow, despite all that cash available for the taking, Manchester United, Chelsea, and Liverpool are all outside the top four of the EPL table.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">European powerhouses, like Barcelona, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Juventus, and Paris St. Germain, will surely be enticed by the idea of a breakaway league, given the venture translates to more financial gains than the ones they are currently enjoying from Europe’s premier competition. Not that they are in some sort of financial trouble, but the troublesome idea of a Real Madrid or a Barcelona being financially matched by the likes of Stoke City or Southampton when acquiring quality players is quite realistic. The financial figures for Premier League sides are not there just yet, of course, but if the size and scale of the English Premier League keeps blossoming, that sort of situation will surely arrive sooner rather than later.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“The Premier League’s collective annual TV income of €1.92bn is over double that of Europe’s next best league, with Italy’s Serie A hitting €888m.</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">While Manchester United are the only Premier League side in the top five -- second to Real Madrid, but ahead of Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Paris Saint-German -- 12 of the 30 richest European clubs by income are from England.</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">Clubs in the Premier League also make more from ticket sales per year than any other European league, with average takings of €34.3m (aggregate €685m) compared to the next-best Bundesliga with €26.3 (€474m).”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— ESPN FC Staff, <em><a href="http://www.espnfc.us/barclays-premier-league/story/2676914/premier-league-clubs-to-overtake-nfl-tv-earning-by-2017-uefa" target="_blank">Premier League clubs to top NFL TV earnings by 2017 - UEFA report</a></em></p>

				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">All of this brings forth the following question: Who should play in the European “Super” League? And we haven’t even begun to cover the questions of how exactly the league is going to be implemented. The legal hurdles still exist. And the process that clubs could use to gain entry into this “exclusive” tournament further on down the road remains unclear. This will take a lot of time to make it a reality, all the while there is already a competition for the worthy ones called the UEFA Champions League. Granted, it isn’t perfect, but consensus on the restructuring and reforms are surely much more attainable than completely disrupting the status quo.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“People must think what the fans want, not only about money. Because culture and the fans are more important than other things.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">—  Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri providing his candid thoughts on the European Super League</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Leicester City’s fairy-tale rise to the top of the Premier League has been inspirational to many this season. I, for one, am certainly looking forward to their participation in the Champion’s League next season. Their counter-attacking style of football going to be very well-suited against other European opposition, much like when a Jürgen Klopp-led Borussia Dortmund crashed the Champions League party in the not-so-distant past. That is how history can be made in a positive way, and it’s something that us football fans will be deprived of if the European “Super” League comes to pass in the not-so-distant future.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The best option is to continue to provide improvements and innovations to the current version of the Champions League. What improvements can be made is something to be discussed on another day. For now, I’m going to go back to deciding which football game to play. And, of course, the wacky European “Super” League video game won’t be on the menu. I wonder if the parties involved in the discussion at the Dorchester Hotel knew of the existence of this video game. I’m sure they’ll cringe and look on in disgust by the sight of IFK Göteborg, a club playing in a league called the Allsvenskan in Sweden being in the “Super” group.</p></div>
