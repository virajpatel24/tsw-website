				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Over the course of this 2015/16 English Premier League season, I have struggled to nail down the perfect word to describe Manchester United and their manager, Louis van Gaal. Words like “rigid” and “delusional” have been thrown around by yours truly whenever the subject was brought up. The word “philosophy” has also been used sporadically by other columnists - but usually in a mocking (and often derogatory) way - in reference to Mr. van Gaal’s favorite word when asked about his side’s lack of cutting edge. All of that nonsense simply erupted once more when the gaffer himself made the following statement in the build-up to last Sunday’s match against Liverpool:</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“When I was younger, I was like Klopp. Now, at 64, I can control my passion more. I don’t think the referees in England are influenced by what the manager or the fans do. Every manager has his own identity, his own personality, and his own philosophy. When I started my career I did that [Klopp-like actions], also. But I don’t think you can influence from the touchline.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Louis van Gaal, informing journalists of his trademarked touchline passivity (especially when compared to that of Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp)</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">When prodded to elaborate further as to why exactly he stopped shepherding the touchline, LvG gave this unexpected answer:</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“I did a karate kick. It was the 1995 Champions League final, Ajax against AC Milan, and I did a flying kick. We won 1-0, but we should have had a penalty for a high tackle on [Jari] Litmanen. I was angry, so I did a karate kick on the touchline - about a foot away from the fourth official’s face. I wanted to show him what had happened to Litmanen. It should have been a penalty, but the referee did not whistle for a penalty. And in that moment, I realised that a manager can never influence the referee by what he does on the touchline. I realized that you have to control your passion.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Louis van Gaal, revealing the origins of his passiveness on the touchline</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">I know, right? Personally, I can’t even imagine Louis van Gaal doing a karate kick on the touchline at Anfield, much less leaving the confines of his comfy managerial seat. The look on Klopp’s face would surely be priceless if he had to bear witness to that incident. Antics by the two devil-may-care managers aside, what I derived from the statement made by Mr. van Gaal is that the near-perfect, self-imposed word he used during that retelling - “restraint” - also fully describes him and his club, interestingly enough. The way in which United have played their football up to this point, the “philosophy” mind you, is one of relentless restraint. How else can you describe a squad, which has a plethora of attacking talents that can tear up any Premier League defense (supposedly), that has been reduced to playing like the way they’re accustomed to nowadays? It’s all become clear now, though, thanks to the enlightening statement from the man in charge.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Incidentally, however, just like the 1995 Champions League final, the scoreline at Anfield this weekend ended up at 1-0, in favor of Louis van Gaal’s Manchester United, who now reside fifth place in the EPL table (37 points). The circumstances may have been different this time around, but nonetheless, even a narrow win is still a win. The man responsible for the solitary goal is, of course, the captain himself, Wayne Rooney. Aided by some sloppy Liverpool defending off of a set piece (surprise, surprise), Wazza thundered in an unstoppable shot past goalkeeper Simon Mignolet, after Marouane Fellaini’s header clanked off of the crossbar. Rooney has been on a tear lately, with this goal against Liverpool marking his fifth in four matches this year. He also broke the record of most goals with a single Premier League club, surpassing Arsenal legend Thierry Henry, who had 175 strikes to his name during his Gunners days. Goal number 176 couldn’t have come at a better time and place for Rooney, with the game-winning goal being his first at Anfield in 11 years.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">If anything, Rooney is showing signs of a striker being freed of his shackles as of late. Whether that’s by design - which I seriously doubt - or simply a matter of the team’s captain taking the initiative to fire up the team in his own way, free from the soul-sucking “philosophy” of his manager, is up for debate. So far, there have been no complaints whatsoever from the gaffer that indicate the former theory. Hence, the latter explanation seems possible, considering that Rooney is the captain and soul of United’s attack. For Louis van Gaal, he simply just can’t afford to lose the dressing room, especially considering the current woes he is facing. I don’t think Ed Woodward, the Red Devils’s executive vice-chairman, can show much more “restraint” if the downslide happens again. There’s only so much that even a patient man like Mr. Woodward can take.</p></div>

				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="https://www.facebook.com/manchesterunited/photos/pb.7724542745.-2207520000.1453205745./10153456617967746/" target="_blank">MANCHESTER UNITED FACEBOOK ACCOUNT</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">As evidenced by their 1-0 victory over Liverpool, however lackluster it may have been, in the end, it’s the W and three points that matter. Louis van Gaal won’t be losing any sleep over this. After all, taking into account the bitter rivalry between both clubs, a win against arch-rivals Liverpool will bear considerably more weight to forwarding van Gaal’s cause. Moreover, the confidence and morale of the entire squad should have been boosted, if not maintained, from this victory. All of this bodes well as United look towards their next EPL match at Old Trafford on Saturday against Ronald Koeman’s Southampton.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“We can do it. This game shall give a big boost to the players, the fans and everyone in the environment of Manchester United. Now we have made a good start in 2016, to beat Liverpool for the second time in a row is marvellous, it gives a big boost for the players and the fans so I hope it shall continue with winning. That is why we are here, to win our games and at the end of the season to be in the first three positions of the league.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Louis van Gaal, addressing the media after the match against Liverpool</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Really? While it is not outside the realm of possibility, it is more likely that the Red Devils are going to be fighting with both Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham United for that highly-coveted fourth spot come season’s end. For someone who has exercised restraint in every other aspect of his footballing career, the gaffer surely doesn’t show it when faced with a mic and camera. Maybe it’s the glamor and spectacle of it all that’s so enticing and welcoming. But proclaiming confidently that his team will challenge for the top three, let alone the top spot, immediately after a lackluster showing against Liverpool is laughable at best. It’d do wonders for his side if Louis van Gaal can show enough “restraint” when facing the media so that another “karate kick moment,” like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEfFGtIxXzo" target="_blank">storming off in a press conference</a> when rumors of him being replaced reached their boiling point, isn’t repeated. Speaking of which, here’s the video of Mr. van Gaal himself doing the infamous karate kick as alluded to earlier. Enjoy!</p></div>
