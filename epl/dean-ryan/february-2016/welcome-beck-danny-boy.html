				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The tension surrounding this match was palpable from the outset. It was exactly the kind of feeling you get heading into a big match, especially when it can shape the race for the title. In that vein, one would be forgiven in thinking that this was a showdown between the titans of the English Premier League, like those of the past between Manchester United and Liverpool, or Chelsea and Arsenal. However, thanks to the volatility of the 2015-16 English Premier League season, when a top-of-the-table Leicester City faced off against perennial title contenders or pretenders (depending on the season and individual point of view), Arsenal on a breezy Sunday morning in North London, it was a matchup of titanic proportions. The only thing that remained to be seen was whether Claudio Ranieri’s or Arsène Wenger’s ship would hit the iceberg first.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Unlike the buildup towards the <a href="citys-curtain-call.html">Leicester vs Manchester City match last week</a>, which, to me at least, was overshadowed by the looming arrival of Pep Guardiola to the Etihad, the match against Arsenal had the semblance of a classic title showdown. No insults or name-calling was needed to promote or sell this match. Both sets of teams, be it the players or managers, or legends for that matter, remained respectful even when they were taking jabs at each other. José Mourinho, who’s always up for a grudge match or two, must have cringed while sitting on his sofa and witnessing the inordinately calm buildup to this match.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Make no mistake, though. Amidst all the media formalities, the spirit of competition and passion clearly burned inside both of those teams. This was, after all, a match with title implications. A win for Leicester would have enabled them to widen the margin over their fellow contenders, while a win for Arsenal would have stalled the Foxes’ march and ensured that the Gunners remained in the running for the title. Both sides came into the match after a win in their previous one, although the Leicester’s victory over City was much more impressive than the Gunners’ victory over Bournemouth. With Leicester seemingly in better form and Arsenal’s affinity for unpredictability, all signs pointed towards a highly charged encounter at the Emirates. And boy did it deliver!</p></div>
				
				<img src="feb-epl-article-images/simpson-red-card.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="https://www.facebook.com/premierleague/photos/a.408877845803303.98644.220832481274508/1270392839651795/" target="_blank">PREMIER LEAGUE FACEBOOK ACCOUNT</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In what turned out to be a very competitive match, both sides started true to their style of play, with Arsenal controlling possession and Leicester countering with pace. Both goalkeepers got to flex their muscle, with Petr Čech drawing excellent saves from Jamie Vardy and N’Golo Kanté, while Kasper Schmeichel performed his own interpretation of a sweeper-keeper while defending those dangerous Arsenal fastbreaks. But the highlight of the first half was, of course, Vardy’s penalty, conceded by Nacho Monreal off of a cheeky move in the penalty area by the Leicester striker himself. The finish was emphatic, of course, leaving the Gunners with plenty to ponder about at half-time.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">With three yellow cards already having been brandished by referee Martin Atkinson to Arsenal before the break, it was only a matter of time before someone got sent off, with Laurent Koscielny and Francis Coquelin being the prime candidates for the dubious honor. However, it was not to be as it was Leicester, instead, who got one of their players sent off. Danny Simpson was the culprit as he foolishly decided to commit yet another foul in plain view of Mr. Atkinson, just five minutes after being booked by the official. Incidentally, this changed the complexion of the match and paved the way for an Arsenal comeback.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">It was not until the 70th minute that the Gunners finally scored the equalizing goal. In what was their first shot on target, Theo Walcott scored off an Olivier Giroud-headed assist just nine minutes after coming on. The quest for the winning goal turned out to be a very difficult one, with Leicester shutting down every Arsenal attempt with their impressive defense, led by Kasper Schmeichel. Gunners fans probably had a hellish reminder of his legendary father Peter Schmeichel, who was an ever-present figure between the sticks for the Manchester United sides of the 1990s.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Ironically, it took a former Red Devil to rescue Arsenal from the hands of death in a way that even the now-retired Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson would have been proud of. Returning from a nightmare injury hiatus, Danny Welbeck came on in the 83rd minute for his first match action since April 2015. And in unpredictable Arsenal fashion, Welbeck duly guided home a perfect delivery from the “<a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/row-zed/mesut-ozil-created-more-seasons-7374630" target="_blank">King of Assists</a>” Mesut Özil for the last-gasp winner, sending the Emirates into a frenzy. The 25-year-old Welbeck took it all in his stride in this fairytale return and remained grounded for the right reasons.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“It’s important, but the most important thing was to get the three points, get the win and close the gap at the top. It has been a roller-coaster for me, a difficult moment, and my family and friends know what I have been through. It’s a beautiful feeling. It’s only one goal. I want to be out there playing minutes and staying fit.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Danny Welbeck, talking about his miracle goal to <em>Sky Sports</em> after the match</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Indeed, I agree with Welbeck on his assessment. This victory, however dramatic, only closed the gap with Leicester to just two points. The Gunners ended the weekend just as they had started it: Still in third and, more importantly, still behind Spurs! With the Foxes expected to bounce back against Norwich when the Premier League returns in less than two weeks (no Premiership action this weekend thanks to the FA Cup), Arsenal faces a much tougher task ahead, with matches against Barcelona (in the Champions League) and Manchester United (when they return to league action) coming up.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">With the path to the Premier League title as difficult as ever for Arsenal, they can learn a thing or two from Danny Welbeck on perseverance and his never-give-up attitude. Gunners fans might as well brace themselves for whatever obstacles and difficulties that will surely come, namely in the form of probable humiliation against Barcelona. Who knows, they might nick the title right at the death, a la Manchester City under Roberto Mancini back in the 2011-12 season. That can be the ultimate dramatic ending for the entire Arsenal institution. But for now, lets just welcome their match savior, Danny Welbeck, back into the fold.</p></div>
