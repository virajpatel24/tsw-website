				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">West Ham have surprised me tremendously this season. They are up there with Leicester City and Chelsea in terms of the season’s litter box full of surprises. But don’t worry, unlike José Mourinho’s underachieving Blues, they are surprising me in a good way. The acquisition of Dimitri Payet from Marseille was the first surprise that I got from them. How they managed to lure a hugely talented player like Payet, who’s operating at the peak of his powers, continues to baffle me to no end. Then, there’s the way that West Ham has performed thus far in the English Premier League. Handing out drubbings to Arsenal, Liverpool, and Manchester City at their respective homes is no small feat. To their credit, they also beat Chelsea, although this isn’t really a surprise at this point considering Chelsea’s current 16th-place standing in the EPL table. But above all else, the Hammers’ biggest surprise for me came in the form of a special talent named Manuel Lanzini.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Truth be told, I didn’t know anything about him when West Ham signed him. Who was this guy? The fact that he was signed on loan from Al-Jazira, a club in the United Arab Emirates didn’t help matters. Add to that the buzz surrounding the signing of Dimitri Payet at the time and you have the perfect recipe for a massive undervaluing of Lanzini. Maybe that was just my fault and my plain ignorance on what a precocious talent he was capable of being all along; that is why I’m not a glorified football scout in the first place.</p></div>	
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“There are deep playmakers like (Andrea) Pirlo or (Luka) Modrić or you have playmakers between the lines like (David) Silva. He’s more like him but he can play in all positions behind the strikers.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— West Ham coach Slaven Bilić, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3171421/Manuel-Lanzini-David-Silva-Slaven-Bilic-boasts-new-West-Ham-United-signing-just-like-Manchester-City-playmaker.html" target="_blank">raving about Manuel Lanzini to <em>The Daily Mail</em></a></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This statement should have served as an eye opener for anyone who cares about the club. Being compared to a world-class attacking midfielder like David Silva was seen as a kind gesture of sorts by many, an attempt by Bilić to hype and justify his loan acquisition. But Bilić knew about his player’s ethereal abilities from the get-go, and after 12 games into the season, Bilić’s belief about Lanzini’s talent has become generally accepted. Now, it’s only a matter of when (not if) Lanzini is able to reach the heights of David Silva, and maybe beyond.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Lanzini made his debut in the English Premier League against Leicester City back in August, coming off the bench in a 2-1 loss to the Foxes, who are currently comfortably situated in third place in the table with 25 points from 12 matches. However, the Argentinian made his impact known from his very first start - in a match against Liverpool at Anfield no less. He scored in the third minute to help his club to a 3-0 win. Aside from the goal, his work rate off the ball was also impressive as he did his part in helping the defense, thanks to eight thundering tackles. That changed the perception of the Hammers fans and of course, his own coach Slaven Bilić, who decided to start him in every match since then.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The player himself hasn’t looked back since. To date, he has recorded a total of three goals and one assist with an 88.2% pass success rate and averaging 2.3 dribbles per game. Not bad for a player who is transitioning from playing in the Middle East to the rigors of the English Premier League. Besides, the primary creative force for the Hammers has been Dimitri Payet, and with the spotlight away from Lanzini, he was afforded a lengthy acclimatization period. However, that will soon change. In the match against Everton just before the international break, Payet suffered an ankle injury, ruling him out for the next three months.</p></div>
				
				<img src="nov-epl-article-images/lanzini.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="https://provenquality.cdn.speedyrails.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/manuel-lanzini-west-ham-liverpool_3343611.jpg" target="_blank">WWW.PROVENQUALITY.COM</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Thanks to Lanzini’s presence, West Ham’s fans need not worry. The player nicknamed ‘The Jewel’ or ‘La Joya’ is no stranger to the spotlight or to the added responsibility. After all, we are talking about a player who was given the number 10 shirt of River Plate at the young age of just twenty. That he was entrusted with a number worn by names like Ariel Ortega, Andrés D’Alessandro, Pablo Aimar, and Marcelo Gallardo before him speaks volumes about his talent and importance to a prestigious club like River Plate. He is 22-years-old now, and although he is wearing the number 28 at West Ham, his role is set to be as a number 10 after the international break, ostensibly allowing the young Lanzini the capability to influence matches even more now that Payet is out for a significant amount of time.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">His path to the English Premier League has been unconventional to say the least. While his Argentine compatriot and former River comrade, Ramiro Funes Mori cut a straightforward path from the Argentine Primera Division to Everton, ‘Jewel’ decided to join Al-Jazira in the UAE Pro League instead amid protracted interest from a host of European clubs, including the then Slaven Bilić-led Beşiktaş. While the logic behind the transfer is foggy at best, the Hammers fans should be grateful that they get to witness a player as talented as Lanzini grow and develop at the Boleyn Ground.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">At the moment, it should be noted that Lanzini’s stay at West Ham is only on a temporary basis (one-year loan deal from Al-Jazira) and although the Hammers have the option to sign him permanently, they should know that the bigger and more prestigious clubs will be circling around like vultures, planning to swoop in at the first sign of Lanzini expressing a desire to leave. Should that departure ultimately happen, Liverpool is the most recently mentioned club to be in the running as they look to strengthen under new manager Jürgen Klopp. With the asking price set at eight million pounds by Al-Jazira, ‘the Jewel’ is undoubtedly getting on the radar of major clubs, to the detriment of West Ham.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Efforts are under way to make the transfer permanent however, and while it seems likely that Lanzini will sign, West Ham should be cautious, too. After all, this is a club that played host to the Argentine duo of Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano at one point in the recent past before the duo both moved on to ply their trade elsewhere in England in 2007 (Tevez moved to Manchester United; Mascherano moved to Liverpool). Still, the best-case scenario would be for Lanzini to stay on till the end of the season and though fans will be disappointed, they should not feel aggrieved at all. After all, a precious jewel belongs in a crown, and right now, there are much better crowns out there.</p></div>
