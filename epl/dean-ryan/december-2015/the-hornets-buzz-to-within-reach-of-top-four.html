				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp would have been forgiven in thinking that he was actually back in Germany, watching his former side - Borussia Dortmund - dismantle the giant in red - FC Bayern Munich. Now, while that notion would have certainly lifted his spirits, the reality is that he is now in charge of the club donning the color red. Klopp’s new club isn’t the German juggernaut called Bayern Munich; instead, he landed at the once-great Liverpool. And instead of the spacious Signal Iduna Park (Germany’s biggest stadium, per capacity), the setting was at the diminutive Vicarage Road. Instead of the world-class talents of Mario Götze and Robert Lewandowski, the fans were treated to the “Who’s that?!?” talents of Troy Deeney and Odion Ighalo.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“It was the wrong decision but we made more wrong decisions. We lost our minds and stopped playing football - a really bad start to the game.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Jürgen Klopp, during his post-match comments</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">While Klopp might have been forgiven for his assertions, his players were certainly deserving of a few aspersions. Clearly, his notion that they “lost [their] minds” was a perfect metaphor for what happened to the Reds out in the field. It was utter madness. Whatever their gameplan was, it was instantly ripped to shreds by Watford’s Nathan Ake - currently on loan from Chelsea - in the third minute of play. Liverpool’s custodian Adam Bogdan probably had a similar feeling of utter collapse as well, having seen his error of bouncing the ball, instead of catching it outright, being exploited by the aforementioned Ake. Claims that he had already caught the ball and it was kicked out of his hands was simply just an excuse. He should have done better. For example, he could’ve followed the lead of Heurelho Gomes, who had one heck of a time in between the posts for Watford: Catch it cleanly, don’t bounce it. And if you’re pressed, then just punch it clear.</p></div>

				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="https://www.facebook.com/premierleague/photos/pb.220832481274508.-2207520000.1450896591./1235592129798533/" target="_blank">EPL FACEBOOK ACCOUNT</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But enough about Liverpool’s lows, let’s talk about the team in the spotlight, Watford. Surely, nobody would have seen this brilliance coming from Quique Sánchez Flores’s side. A thorough beating of an established and storied Premier League side and a lofty position of seventh in the Premier League table is an apt description for a team like Everton or Southampton. However, the Hornets currently sit comfortably higher than both of those teams. That they were just promoted from the Championship this season made their rise an even more compelling story. Then again, this season’s Premier League has been one crazy ride. This season, we already have unheralded Leicester at the top of the table while the defending champions Chelsea are in a relegation dogfight. If we put things into that sombering perspective, then Watford’s placing right now isn’t all that surprising, I suppose.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">For the record, they now have collected 28 points after 17 matches, boasting eight wins, four draws, and five losses. They are just one point behind the trio of Spurs, Manchester United and Crystal Palace, who occupy the fourth, fifth, and sixth-place spots, respectively. To think that they are on the verge of the European places made for some extraordinary reading. Like I mentioned earlier, Watford just got promoted this season, and so they weren’t supposed to be this high in the league. Their priority was to stave off relegation like any normal promoted sides do. But, they’ve torn off the script, much like a lot of other teams are doing in the league right now. Granted, they still have 12 more points to go in order to reach the psychological barrier of 40 points that is usually able to keep a club, like Watford, safe from relegation. That’s four more wins to go and it looks downright achievable with their current performance levels.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The amount of new personnel coming into Watford at the beginning of the season was simply staggering and baffling at the time. It falls just short of a complete overhaul of the club with, most notably, the manager being replaced as well. Gone was Slaviša Jokanović, who led the club to promotion, and in came Quique Sánchez Flores, who had led a storied managerial career. Yet, with all the turnovers going on at the club, the crucial duo of Troy Deeney and Odion Ighalo remained steadfast at the club, clearly being recognized as the cornerstones of this current squad. Together, they plundered 41 goals between them in the Championship last season and so far, their partnership has managed to adapt to the more rigorous pace and more blinding space of the Premier League. Currently, they have 17 goals between them, with Ighalo responsible for 12 goals scored, placing him just behind Everton’s Romelu Lukaku and the Leicester strike squad of Riyad Mahrez and Jamie Vardy.</p></div>
				
				<img src="dec-epl-article-images/watford-win.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="https://www.facebook.com/watfordfc/photos/pb.21223691814.-2207520000.1450677829./10153664562296815/" target="_blank">WATFORD FC FACEBOOK ACCOUNT</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">While the goals have been handy in acquiring crucial points, the Hornets defense has been quietly going about their business, shutting out their opposition and stopping them however they can. This has led to the team only conceding 16 goals thus far, tying at fourth-best alongside Crystal Palace and Stoke. They are only behind Arsenal, Spurs, and Manchester United on the defensive side of things, even placing better than title challengers Manchester City and league leaders Leicester. The defense, organized by the surprisingly reliable figure of Heurelho Gomes in goal and Northern Irishman Craig Cathcart, has been responsible for the defensive solidity being displayed so far. Add to that to the midfield screen of the aggressive Étienne Capoue and the plucky Ben Watson, and we have a Watford side that is very hard to break down, as Liverpool found out to their detriment this past Sunday night.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“We should be humble. This is our one advantage, because the Premier League is very tough. We have a lot of matches to play. We never underestimate the teams we play. Of course we want to dream, but we want to remain humble.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Quique Sánchez Flores, on his side’s chance to break into the top four</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In a crazy Premier League season so far, it is only a formality before an ambitious claim is being made by someone, be it fans or pundits alike, when an unheralded team is performing extremely well. In Watford’s case, their gaffer Quique Sánchez Flores is remaining grounded on his team’s chances, preferring to take a similar route paved by a <a href="foxes-flying-high-part-ii.html">Claudio Ranieri-led Leicester City</a>. It is understandable too, given the nature of the league, one’s fortunes could be reversed over the course of a single game. More challenges awaits the Hornets starting on Boxing Day, where they face what could be a resurgent Chelsea side, now under the command of Guus Hiddink at Stamford Bridge. For now, though, they can enjoy the Christmas celebrations with a deeply satisfied smile.</p></div>
