				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Almost a year ago, the match between Sunderland and Leicester ensured the Foxes’ survival in the English Premier League. It ended 0-0, which was hardly surprising at the time, considering how both clubs were comfortably languishing in the bottom quartile of the league table. They both desperately needed the points, and a draw was the safest route. But it also meant that the match wasn’t all that interesting, especially for the neutrals, who would’ve preferred to focus on, let’s say, a matchup between illustrious sides like Manchester United and Tottenham.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Fast forward to the present, and the neutrals, including me, have no problem whatsoever carving out time to watch a Sunderland vs. Leicester match. The reasons are quite well-known. The Black Cats are fighting for survival, as usual, while the Foxes are chasing the Premier League title and, to a lesser extent, a spot in Europe’s premier club competition, the UEFA Champion’s League. Two important objectives which are, however, at vastly differing ends of the spectrum this time around.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Now, in my culture, when a black cat crosses your path, it means bad luck. So, when a league-leading Leicester visited Sunderland, a club serving as the living embodiment of the black cat, this past Sunday, I got a little worried. This isn’t to say I am a fervent supporter of Claudio Ranieri’s men. But their feel-good story has been refreshing this season, and I’d be furious if it were to come to an end all because of Big Sam’s resurging squadron of cats. Thankfully, Leicester remained calm under duress.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Apparently, when a black cat blocks a fox’s path, it gets ruthlessly eaten alive, as I would come to learn after this weekend. Whatever little superstitious cultural beliefs I held pre-match were torn to shreds by Jamie “Don’t Doubt Me” Vardy’s brace during the match. Leicester, of course, prevailed 2-0 at the Stadium of Light and booked their place in next season’s Champion’s League. And, in the process, King Claudio’s little empire took one-(more)-small-step-for-mankind closer to the Premier League title.</p></div>

				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="http://gazzettaworld.gazzetta.it/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jamie-Vardy-Leicester.jpg?v=20160410165413" target="_blank">WWW.GAZZETTAWORLD.GAZZETTA.IT</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">A year ago, there was no such thing as a “classic Jamie Vardy goal.” Yet, that was the term used in the on Sunday by the commentators when he broke the deadlock in the 66th minute. “Classic Jamie Vardy goal.” Who would’ve thought to utter such a phrase even at the start of this season? But such is the familiarity we have all become accustomed to when it comes to the type of goals that Jamie Vardy has scored this season. Running off the shoulders of the last defender has become Vardy’s finishing move, akin to John Cena’s FU or Stone Cold’s stunner. And once he does the deed, he’s not shy to scream “FU” and stun the opposing crowds, either (presumably).</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">That goal took him to 20 goals on the season. He added another one deep into stoppage time to take his tally to 21, putting him just one shy of top scorer Harry Kane. He also became the first Leicester player to score 20 in the top flight since a certain club legend by the name of Gary Lineker did it back in the 1984-85 season. Quite an achievement to be spoken in the same breadth as the England legend, although Vardy himself has the opportunity to surpass him even further by winning the title with Leicester.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“It is brilliant, but the main thing is the team. We wanted to get three points and that’s what we’ve done. It’s a step closer to possibly winning the league.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Jamie Vardy, shrugging off his record-setting performance by emphasizing the club and the title</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">How can anyone NOT like this team? Their star player sets a record and he just downplays it by insisting that the team and its quest for the Premier League title remains his top priority. Heck, even when mentioning the league title, he still oozes humility by implying that it is still only a possibility, not a certainty. No wonder Lady Luck is with them in their quest. Golden State Warriors owner Joe <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/03/magazine/what-happened-when-venture-capitalists-took-over-the-golden-state-warriors.html" target="_blank">“It’s all me, I did this”</a> Lacob, take notes.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">A year ago, a match between Leicester and Barcelona would’ve been dismissed as pish-posh. Or, that maybe Barcelona was only planning to play a pre-season friendly match against Leicester in their hypothetical tour of low-level English Premier League clubs. Alas, in the present, that pipe dream is no longer fantasy; absurdity has transformed into possibility. It is nearing reality that both clubs can play with each other in a competitive fixture instead of a measly friendly.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">With their victory over Sunderland, Leicester are now guaranteed of a Champion’s League spot for next season. This means that it’s not only the prospect of facing Barcelona that is possible, they can also face the other giants of Europe, like Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Juventus, and Paris St. Germain. Talk about swimming with the sharks of the ocean. We’re talking about an ocean filled with blue whales, great white sharks, and giant squids here. Not bad for a fox.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">After seeing what they did to the so-called “big” clubs in the English Premier League, I am drooling over imagining what they can do under the bright lights of European competition. And I am certain that most football fans would love to see the Little Leicester That Could on this grand stage, too. I guess, what I am looking forward to the most is their evolution as a team heading into next season. With European action on the menu, they’ll need an even bigger squad and more quality players to challenge on all fronts. Their manager, Claudio Ranieri, will no doubt be planning rigorously in the offseason.</p></div>
				
				<img src="apr-epl-article-images/ranieri.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="http://gazzettaworld.gazzetta.it/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Claudio-Ranieri-Leicester-City3-1024x757.jpg?v=20160410191426" target="_blank">WWW.GAZZETTAWORLD.GAZZETTA.IT</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Based on their performances this season, Ranieri won’t have to worry too much, though. However, retaining players like Riyad Mahrez and N’Golo Kante will be key to a successful summer. With Champions League football on the docket, it wouldn’t be too hard to retain these dynamos for at least one more season. Enticing other quality players to join in the fun will not be so difficult after all, although they will need to be stringent as to who they admit.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">A change in tactics may also be at hand in order to cope with the demands of next season. A more conventional 4-2-3-1 formation may be deployed in certain games. Meanwhile, their swashbuckling, counter-attacking style of football may be properly used in their European sojourns. In terms of natural progression of players, Danny Drinkwater looks like he’s about to replicate Andrea Pirlo. In terms of style that is, not the long locks and beard. He definitely has the potential to be that type of player in midfield, just look at his sublime assist for Vardy’s first goal. Demarai Gray is also primed to break out next season, having just recently joined the club in January. With his skills and dribbling ability, he offers a great threat from the wings, which could mean that Riyad Mahrez may be moved into a more central position.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Whatever the case may be, these are exciting times, especially if you are a Leicester City Football Club fan. With Champions League qualification secured, all eyes will be focused on the impending Premier League crown. They hold a seven point lead over the second-placed Spurs, which is quite a sizable gap. But the Foxes must not prepare for their rightful coronation just yet. They need to tackle the remaining games one game at a time, one clean sheet at a time. The one-goal outings have been stressful to appreciate. But hey, if those do the job of getting all three points, who am I to argue? The Foxes are still flying high heading into the final six games, and I certainly hope I am able to write the final chapter of their journey for this season, with their team crowned as the 2015-16 English Premier League champions.</p></div>
