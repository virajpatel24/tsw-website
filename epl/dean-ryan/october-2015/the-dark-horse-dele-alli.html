				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">It’s not exactly football’s best kept secret. No, I’m not talking about Sepp Blatter’s sneaky, corrupt antics over at the FIFA headquarters. Instead, I’m thinking about the ingredients needed in order to succeed in world football (or in any other sport for that matter): talent, hard work, and some lucky breaks. Combine these three together and the resulting trifecta will birth a superstar. A trifecta simply cannot exist without the superstar, and vice versa. Yet, the most influential aspect of the success trident is luck. Being lucky has its perks. “Lucky” in terms of major injuries avoided. “Lucky” in terms of joining the right team, with the right system, with the right manager and backroom staff. “Lucky,” with the proper timing of it all.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">“Lucky” is the term that best describes England international and Tottenham Hotspur Dele Alli’s situation. It’s not that he didn’t deserve it. He’s worked hard, he’s performed at his best at every club level, and now he’s getting called up to play for England. Sure, there are more qualified, illustrious candidates ahead of him, but unlucky injuries have set all of them back. Jack Wilshere, Jordan Henderson, Ryan Mason, Michael Carrick, and Fabian Delph are all currently recovering from injuries. And with England already qualified for the Euro 2016 finals in France, there simply isn’t a better time for a young lion to showcase his talent on the international stage.</p></div>
		
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">"It's never been easier to win an England call-up. If anyone doubted that, Roy Hodgson's latest squad proved how quickly a young player can be elevated. Dele Alli's inclusion in the group for the games against Lithuania and Estonia was the selection which caused eyebrows to be raised...”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Jamie Carragher, as quoted in <em>The Mail</em></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Eyebrows raised? Yes. Easy? No. England manager, Roy Hodgson, answered back:</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">"I think you have to be careful with those sorts of comments. It's not a situation where, the moment you kick the ball correctly from A to B, you'll get in the England team. It's not like that at all. With Dele Alli you have to bear in mind the number of injuries we've had..."</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Roy Hodgson, as quoted by reporters</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">And Hodgson’s correct: Dele Alli’s inclusion was not without merit. Granted, his name would not have even been considered had all of the aforementioned injured stars been available in the squad. But considering the long list of injuries for England, Carragher should be thankful that in spite of all these setbacks, England still has someone to call upon and, incidentally, the matches against Estonia and Lithuania were rubber matches!</p></div>
				
				<img src="oct-epl-article-images/roy-hodgson.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/11925674/Lithuania-vs-England-Dele-Alli-to-play-key-role-for-Roy-Hodgson-in-Euro-2016-qualifier.html" target="_blank">WWW.TELEGRAPH.CO.UK</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Luck played its part at Spurs, too. Injuries to first choice midfielders Nabil Bentaleb and Ryan Mason have fortuitously paved the way for Dele Alli to nail down a place in Mauricio Pochettino’s starting eleven. So far, he has repaid his manager’s faith in him with solid, if not spectacular, performances. That consistency has enabled him to hold his own against world-class opposition midfielders, too, having already successfully faced Manchester City’s Yaya Toure (4-1 win for Spurs) in the EPL and Monaco’s Joao Moutinho (1-1 draw) in the Europa League. His poise in the biggest games speaks volumes about his preternatural talent, which will only continue to blossom considering he is only 19-years-old at the moment.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">He didn’t start in either the match against Estonia or the one against Lithuania, although he did come off the bench on both occasions. As a result, it’s difficult to completely break down his performances for the Three Lions. The fact that Ross Barkley and England’s “perfect 10 wins” Euros qualifying record are hogging the headlines in England doesn’t help in showcasing Alli’s talents. In that aspect, he didn’t get lucky.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But fret not, because time is on his side. Age-wise, he still has a long way to go, being only nineteen at the moment. Making it to the England Euro 2016 squad will be a challenge, but he has the whole English Premier League season ahead of him, alongside participation in the Europa League. And he should be well-aware that as long he performs admirably throughout the season, a place will open up for him in the English squad.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The youth from Milton Keynes should know better than most that performances on the pitch accompanied by hard work on the training ground will lead to more opportunities. Starting at his hometown club Milton Keynes Dons from academy level, he earned a move to Tottenham Hotspur this past February, before being loaned back for the rest of the season. Upon arriving back to MK Dons, he helped the club earn a much-needed promotion to the English Championship, the second tier of English soccer.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">It was at Milton Keynes that he began turning heads. He impressed so much that during that famous match against Manchester United in the League Cup back in the 2014-15 season (Milton Keynes won 4-0), scouts from several top clubs in Europe were watching him, including his boyhood club, Liverpool. Yet, when Liverpool came calling, he decided to turn them down in favor of Spurs.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“When we were looking at moving I think it was really important that we found a manager who was similar to the gaffer (Karl Robinson, Milton Keynes manager). Someone who has a lot of trust in young players and isn’t scared to put them on. I can see that in the manager (at Spurs), so it’s a great move for me...”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Dele Alli, in FourFourTwo magazine</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In hindsight, Dele Alli’s decision to join Spurs instead of Liverpool appears to be a sensible one, if not a masterstroke. The club allowed him to return home to Milton Keynes for the rest of the season to finish the job of helping them to gain promotion. After accomplishing that objective, he re-joined Spurs for his first full tilt at the English Premier League. And now, he is on the brink of achieving a much greater objective.</p></div>
				
				<img src="oct-epl-article-images/alli-iphone.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/dele-alli-loan-spurs-season-not-if-i-can-help-it#:06KH-QvkX+CKcA" target="_blank">WWW.FOURFOURTWO.COM</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">With his first two England caps out of the way, the next challenge will be to sustain his form for Spurs, which will lead to, perhaps, future England call-ups. With Euro 2016 just around the corner, competition for places are going to heat up considerably and Alli will have to focus on performing at the highest of levels in order to earn his place. Those players who are injured right now will become available again soon enough, both at Spurs and at England. This should be enough motivation for a young man like Dele Alli.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">With his uniqueness as a box-to-box midfielder a la Steven Gerrard, he knows he offers something different tactically for England. Incidentally, Steven Gerrard is also his idol, which makes the prospect even more salivating:</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“Steven Gerrard was a massive idol to me when I was younger. It would be unbelievable to have the sort of success he’s had, and even to be compared to him is a huge honour to me. I think I’ve got his desire and hunger, and I don’t like to lose. I’m not going to get too carried away about what’s going to happen in the future but if I achieve great things I’d be really happy and honoured.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Alli, in FourFourTwo magazine</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Obviously, he’s not going to be the best player in England overnight. But, with his unerring abilities and supreme confidence, coupled with a manager in the form of Mauricio Pochettino, his development into one will be very exciting to watch. It’s important that he doesn’t get complacent and let all the spotlight get to his head, though.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“Dele Alli, don’t start pushing with him. He’s still got an awful lot to do.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Roy Hodgson, as quoted by reporters in Vilnius</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Hodgson seems to be wary for now, as he knows how a young player like Alli needs to be handled and is perfectly aware that a player of Alli’s stature is vital to England’s future. If the young Alli keeps his head down and focuses more on developing his game, there’s no telling what we might see of Dele Alli in the Euros next summer. A Steven Gerrard-like figure is always welcomed in any dressing room. Let’s just hope that Dele Alli doesn’t have his idol’s luck when it comes to winning league titles.</p></div>
