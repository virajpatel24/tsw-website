				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">And so it has ended. The battle for survival in the English Premier League was decided on the league’s penultimate matchday. Despite my <a href="../april-2016/newcastles-survival-battle-rages-on.html">rooting for Newcastle</a> to beat the drop, my pragmatism actually <a href="https://soundcloud.com/the-sports-whorl-podcast/ep-55-premier-league-w-viraj-patel-and-ryan-dean" target="_blank">made me choose Sunderland</a> as the most probable team to survive. The only reason I was slightly hesitant to pull for the Black Cats was because of the guy in their dugout, Big Sam Allardyce. Thanks to prior bad experiences bordering on the traumatic - don’t ask - back in the days when Big Sam was managing Bolton, I had skewed my support toward Rafa Benítez and his Newcastle side lately. Ironically, despite his faults, Big Sam himself was exactly what Sunderland needed to survive the drop.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">It’s nothing personal, really. I mean the guy has grown so much since the days at Reebok Stadium. It was his tenure at Bolton - where he continuously employed ultra-defensive tactics and punted the ball upfield - that frustrated Arsenal and their juvenile fan at the time, me. But as a person, he comes off to me as boisterous and honest, yet also street-smart. In fact, I think if we were to meet in person, we would’ve hit it off and become buddies. Heck, he may even decide to envelop me in a spontaneous bear hug. That’s how great a person I think he is.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Philosophical footballing differences aside, though, I have got to give credit where credit is due. The way he turned around Sunderland’s fortunes with effectiveness and efficiency left the fans and neutrals impressed this season. Sure, it took a while to do that, but what manager could hit the ground running at a struggling club? Considering that Aston Villa’s dearly departed coach Rémi Garde didn’t get any sort of running at Villa Park at all, the Black Cats are more than fortunate in that aspect.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">There are a few key moments that turned the season around at Wearside. Take, for instance, the club’s January transfer dealings. Without a doubt the Special K’s - yes, that’s what the Sunderland faithful call the trio of Wahbi Khazri, Jan Kirchhoff, and Lamine Koné at the Stadium of Light nowadays - were inspired signings. Pushing Kirchhoff, a central defender by trade into the defensive midfield role - or the pivot, as I would like to call it - was definitely a genius idea. Both of these moves happened thanks to Big Sam. So in essence, the most vital move and key moment, is when the club hired the big guy to help them escape relegation.</p></div>

				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="http://www.goal.com/en/match/sunderland-vs-everton/2043468/report" target="_blank">WWW.GOAL.COM</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Ever since Big Sam was relieved of his duties at West Ham United this past summer, I had a sense that he was going to come back with a vengeance. His treatment at the hands of the Hammers fans in East London did not help much, either, even though he performed solidly in the dugout at the Boleyn Ground.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">So, when Sunderland came calling, he took on the challenges head on back in October. Mired in the relegation zone? Check. Underperforming, failed reclamation projects and demotivated set of players? Check. The <a href="http://www.theweek.co.uk/premier-league/62760/adam-johnson-jailed-for-six-years-for-child-sex-offences" target="_blank">child-sex offender</a>, Adam Johnson’s vile shadow covering the Stadium of Light? Check. The last one was probably the biggest challenge of all, in PR terms, squad morale, and the fans’ perception of their own club. But Big Sam took it all in his stride.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Facing such challenges, he somehow managed to work it out with whatever he had at his disposal back then. He began to tighten things up on the field, all the while riding out the Adam Johnson storm with exceptional resolve. With the players at hand, that was the most sensible way, and the objective was to hang on till the January transfer window opened. The 6-2 thrashing by Everton at Goodison Park and the losing run of December were particularly hard for the team and Big Sam. He no doubt gritted his teeth and waited patiently, knowing that his reclamation plans would begin soon enough.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“If you look back at November...Everton 6-2 Sunderland, it shows how far we’ve come and it’s been a long few months until we got some players in January and we turned into a team from January onwards. We became difficult to beat, a team that didn’t like losing again and we continued this run through the last 10 games or so.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Sam Allardyce, speaking with Sky Sports post-match</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">January started spectacularly for Sunderland. Big Sam began the month by declaring that he was going to turn Sunderland into the Juventus of England, referencing the famous 3-5-2 formation employed by the Serie A champions. The experiment failed spectacularly, further highlighting my theory that only the 2002 World Cup winning Brazilian team and Juventus could pull off that tactical setup with success. But it didn’t matter that much, since his three smart signings in January were equipped to excel in any formation.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The Special K’s (Khazri, Kirchhoff, Koné) - not to be confused with Kellogg’s famous breakfast cereal - were acquired with the precision of a surgeon. That Big Sam only required these three signings to jumpstart his struggling Black Cats was testament to his unerring confidence and belief in the rest of his squad. Parting with just a measly sum of 15 million pounds for all three speaks volumes of his shrewdness, underlying his mantra of “Recruitment is king.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The recruitment of Wahbi Khazri and Lamine Koné caught my eye the most at the time, considering these two were above average players and are more than capable of joining a Europa League chasing team, instead. Khazri’s arrival solved the creative conundrum plaguing a Sunderland side that struggled to complement and supply top scorer Jermaine Defoe. Koné’s arrival meanwhile solidified the backline, providing Younès Kaboul the partner that he lacks in marshalling the defense.</p></div>
				
				<img src="may-epl-article-images/sunderland-fans.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="http://www.goal.com/en/news/1862/premier-league/2016/05/11/23401302/allardyce-pulls-off-another-great-escape?ICID=TP_HN_3" target="_blank">WWW.GOAL.COM</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The cherry on top, however, was the acquisition of Jan Kirchhoff. A center-back by trade, he was remoulded by Sam Allardyce into a midfield destroyer, a genius move taken by Allardyce right from the Pep Guardiola playbook. The German’s defensive acumen allowed him to add extra security to the defense, which, in the process, tightened up the midfield. His role was simple enough: Win the ball and pass it to a safe area, or better yet, to someone who can instigate attacks. With Yann M’Vila in a box-to-box role and Lee Cattermole playing like an imbecile, constantly harrying opponents, Sunderland were finally equipped with just the right midfield formula for Premier League success.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">All that defensive solidity allowed fullbacks, Patrick van Aanholt on the left and DeAndre Yedlin on the right, to bomb forward at will on the flanks, helping the attack and stretching the play without allowing their defensive shortcomings to be exposed. These extra helpers on the flanks also allowed Khazri and Fabio Borini to cut inside and support Defoe in attack, allowing the striker more room to maneuver and get himself into scoring positions more often. And just like that, with just three shrewd signings in January, Sunderland were on their way to safety.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“The financial side [of staying up], what that gives us in terms of spending is the same for everyone so it’s how wisely we spend it and what we do. Because I think the contribution of the players we got in January has been really big and the next set of recruitment is crucial to make sure the club isn’t cheering a lap of honour to be staying up.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Sam Allardyce, on the future of the club now that they’re safe</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">No doubt buoyed by the show of support by the fans, who flocked to the stadium and cheered loudly till the end, Big Sam has already begun to lay out his vision for the future at Wearside. Unlike the fans he encountered before at West Ham and Newcastle, the lot in Sunderland have been welcoming and supportive of him and his team. It was a sight to behold last week when they beat Chelsea 3-2, and even more with this 3-0 victory over Everton that ensured their Premier League survival. To make it even sweeter, they condemned their archrival over at Tyneside to the deepest recesses of relegation.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Now that they are safe, Sunderland can begin looking forward to what’s next on the horizon. It is imperative for the team to not be embroiled in more survival games next season. Rather, they must conserve energy and improve on this season. If those objectives are met, then Sunderland might be in a healthy position to launch a full-fledged attack on the top half of the table. Additional calvary should arrive this summer for Big Sam as he plans to undergo more shrewd signings. Now that the team will have a proper pre-season for once, hope and optimism are shining down at the appropriately named Stadium of Light. And it’s all thanks to Big Sam. All hail Big Sam!!!</p></div>
