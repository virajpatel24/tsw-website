				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Here at The Sports Whorl, we have reason to believe that our Premier League coverage is being extensively followed - albeit very discreetly - by the Fox-chasing Mauricio Pochettino and his Tottenham Hotspur team. The answer to this revelation is a bit more difficult to discern, although a few probable answers can be conjured. One of them centers around our affiliation to Spurs’ bitter rivals, Arsenal. There’s also that saying about “keep your friends close, keep your enemies closer” that keeps Mauricio tuning in to our podcasts.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Make no mistake, though, we at The Sports Whorl are not fraternizing with the Evil Spurs Empire by any means. Nor are we part of that disgraceful lot that see it fit to <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsene-wenger-admits-arsenal-fan-7871407" target="_blank">stage a tasteless protest</a> at the Emirates this past weekend. In fact, those Gooners couldn’t have been Arsenal supporters to begin with. A simple question to test their Arsenal fealty: Just ask them, “Who was ‘Lord Bendtner’?” If they respond by bringing up a jolly English Lord that history has long forgotten, well, you’ll know they’re not diehard Gunners.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Anyways, for all we know, these protesters may have just been planted by Spurs to make the Gunners institution fall apart from within. “Hit them where they’re weakest,” Master Mauricio must’ve instructed them as the rebel forces departed for the Emirates. So, all the conspiracy theorists can just put their tin foil hat back down and put down all those Dan Brown books, because there’s nothing going on between us and those at White Hart Lane.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">It’s simply a smart move (re: diversion) by Mauricio Pochettino to listen and read through his enemy’s thoughts. Who better to identify your own team’s weaknesses than your enemies, right? When we expounded at length last year about what a <a href="../october-2015/the-dark-horse-dele-alli.html">hidden gem</a> Dele Alli was, Spurs immediately placed resolute, total faith on the youngster. Alli continued to prosper from the get-go, and won the PFA Young Player of the Year award last week. When we pointed out how Spurs were wasting their defensive solidity by churning out draws instead of wins, they immediately tweaked their attacking tactics a bit, and the goals came spilling out, enabling them to win with ease. And these are just two of the game-changing insights they gleaned from us, just the tip of the (Sports Whorl) iceberg.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Now, it seems yet another team and their manager have been taking the Spurs route as well, although I wouldn’t consider them our “enemies,” per say. Ronald Koeman and his Southampton side have been taking notes <a href="../january-2016/trouble-brewing-in-englands-south-side.html">ever since we published an article about them</a> back in January. Improvements have been made in a lot of key areas, particularly regarding individual performances from the “star” players, culminating in a remarkably improved performance in the second half of this season.</p></div>
				
				<img src="may-epl-article-images/koeman.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="http://images1.newscred.com/cD1kY2I2YTU2NjU3MGQ4OTdjMGQ2ODgyMWUyMjY3ZjAzMCZnPTYyZjFlM2EwZTg0Y2M3ZGZkYzFjNzJmY2E4YTFkMWVj" target="_blank">WWW.METRO.CO.UK</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The 4-2 victory over Manchester City this past weekend was somewhat inevitable, then. With the Citizens preparing for their visit of the Santiago Bernabeu in midweek, and Manuel Pellegrini more focused on protesting the timing of the fixture against the Saints, it was safe to assume Pellegrini was going to field a second string side, like he did in the FA Cup. While he didn’t resort to such extreme call-ups of the youth team this time around, it was enough for Southampton to capitalize.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“You can talk about the changes of Manchester City but that is not fair. Give all the credit to Southampton because the performance was fantastic.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Ronald Koeman, imploring the press to focus on Southampton</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Still in the hunt for a Europa League spot, Ronald Koeman has done well to turn the team around since January. Disciplinary and motivational problems affecting players like hat-trick hero Sadio Mané, midfield destroyer Victor Wanyama, and creator-in-chief Dušan Tadić have been alleviated. The team is now in line to finish in the top six. All of these positives point to a manager who is calm under pressure, and capable of containing the egos of his star players enough to rally them around the team’s main cause: Contend for the Europa League spots.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Mané’s hat-trick of goals and Tadic’s hat-trick of assists on Sunday signified the high potential that these players possess when motivated and used correctly in a favorable tactical setup. It’s as if each member of the Starting XI was tuned up telepathically to the next, to the point that their play appeared as harmonious as the London Orchestra. The 4-2 scoreline was unjustifiable from City’s perspective because the Citizens’ performance was shambolic, if not for the enterprising individual effort from 19-year-old Kelechi Iheanacho, City would have become roadkill.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“The three points was the important thing. I’m happy to score the goals for my team and I hope we keep it going. I think all four goals - we’re happy with that! We played fantastic football today and we try to work hard for the next games now.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Sadio Mané, talking with Sky Sports after the match</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">As if Koeman’s insightful response towards revitalizing the Saints is not enough, much-maligned forward Shane Long is also taking the cue of his manager in heeding our wise words from January. Ever since being criticized for his listless performances, he has turned his campaign around and has turned in a career year. A return of ten goals and four assists is the best that he’s ever produced, not even his time at West Brom can match this.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Usually deployed on the right-hand side of the attack, Long’s positioning was altered to a more central one by Koeman, and this stroke of genius has reaped dividends. Be it feeding off a main central striker - usually Graziano Pellè - or leading the line himself, like he did against Manchester City, Long is able to utilize his pace even more and trouble opposition defenders. This has led to an increase of shots per game this season (2.3 - a career high), compared to his career average of 1.5 shots per game. It was he who scored the go-ahead goal for the Saints in the match against City, tormenting the defensive pairing of Nicolás Otamendi and Eliaquim Mangala while also winning the ball three times.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">All of these improvements couldn’t have happened, of course, without the guidance of the highly-intelligent footballing mind of Ronald Koeman. His ability to manage a squad like Southampton on a budget is remarkable, to say the least. Add to that his keen eye for unearthing unknown talent and it becomes evident that the Saints have a gem of a manager on their hands. Just like Mauricio Pochettino before him, he is set to make his move to a bigger club sooner rather than later. With just one year left on his contract, opportunities are available in spades for this talented manager. Maybe the Emirates Stadium will be an enticing destination should Arsène Wenger decide to step down in the near future. Perhaps it is fitting, then, that when Southampton visit White Hart Lane this weekend, it might well prove to be an “audition” of sorts. We at The Sports Whorl will watch with intent, of course, since knocking off Spurs at their home fortress is a telltale sign of a budding Arsenal head honcho.</p></div>
