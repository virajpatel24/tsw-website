				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">As the age-old adage goes: “All good things must come to an end.” And stunningly, we’ve reached the end of the 2015-16 English Premier League season. All the club locker rooms now lie empty, and the superstars have <a href="https://twitter.com/MesutOzil1088/status/732235935862140929" target="_blank">jetted off to warmer climates</a>. Leicester City’s amazing and improbable season that saw them crowned champions for the first time has also come to an enjoyable conclusion. Personally, it has been a really satisfying journey for me throughout the season.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This <a href="../september-2015/foxes-flying-high.html">“Foxes Flying High”</a> series was something that was not planned at all initially. When I first started writing for The Sports Whorl back in September, my first article was on Leicester City, with the rather random title “Foxes Flying High.” I never envisioned that article existing as an integral part of an ongoing series. But I guess, this being the Foxes and all, the phrase “never would have imagined or predicted or expected” doesn’t really apply. And so, here I am, writing the fourth entry in the series, which serves as the fitting conclusion to my coverage of the 2015-16 English Premier League season. It is only right that my season-concluding column ends with the team that started this merry ride the first place.</p></div>
				
				<img src="may-epl-article-images/foxes-walking-1.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="http://www.goal.com/en/news/1862/premier-league/2016/05/16/23550582/comment-farewell-to-a-mad-pl-season?ICID=TP_HN_2" target="_blank">WWW.GOAL.COM</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Leicester’s final match of the season could’ve been drastically different in terms of “who’s guarding who.” By that, I mean who’s forming the guard of honor. As we’ve known for a long time it won’t be Chelsea who will be honored at their home, Stamford Bridge. They’re the ones that will do the honoring, instead, after a horrendous season. The only question was to who. The Blues answered that question themselves over a fortnight ago, when they quashed Spurs’ title dream in that ill-tempered 2-2 draw, and in doing so, crowned Leicester as the champions. Talk about playing the role of “kingmaker” to perfection.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Therefore, it is very fitting then, that the previous winners of the title (Chelsea) welcomed the visit of the newly crowned champions (Leicester) - not that the computer of the English FA cared when it generated the fixtures for the season. The atmosphere was one of serenity however, with both teams having nothing left to play for. Maybe this was in part due to Leicester’s sense of gratuity, to thank the hosts who so graciously helped them win the title. And Chelsea reciprocated with a sense of respect to the team that dethroned them. The 1-1 draw was inevitable, although it did bring up some interesting points for Claudio Ranieri and his flying foxes.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">With a forward-thinking approach to next season’s UEFA Champions League, Leicester came out to a formation mostly associated with teams like Real Madrid, Barcelona, and Bayern Munich. Playing with three midfielders instead of their usual two, the Foxes experimented with a clueless and dithering Chelsea side. Not that it affected the match much, with Ranieri’s side actually appearing uncomfortable in the first half. They reverted back to their usual 4-4-2 formation after the break and immediately transformed into the Leicester we’ve all come to know and love.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“I wanted to check. I played very few times with the three midfielders. It was good, but I was not so happy, and maybe when I changed and we went back to 4-4-2 we played immediately better, we pressed high and it was much better for us. Next season, everything could change, but of course at the beginning we will start with the same shape.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Claudio Ranieri, when asked on his unique tactical shift against Chelsea</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Ranieri’s attempt to try a different tactic should be applauded as this attempt will definitely pinpoint the area where Leicester need to strengthen in the offseason. Not to mention the possibility that their usual 4-4-2 may be inadequate in the face of seasoned Champions League sides. The Foxes are probably going to face a European giant in the group stages, seeing that they will be placed in Pot One when the draw is conducted for the Champions League groups.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">That being said, the three-man midfield experiment didn’t work out as hoped. While Daniel Drinkwater and N’Golo Kanté proved to be one of the best midfield pairings, the midfielder in the advanced role, Andy King, certainly didn’t make the grade. In the 45 minutes he was on the field, he didn’t attempt a single shot. Overall, he only managed 30 touches on the ball, and attempted only 26 passes, with zero key passes and zero dribbles. For a midfielder in an advanced role, this was an abomination.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Compare this to Willian of Chelsea, who played the full 90 minutes in an almost similar position. The Brazilian had two shots, 66 touches on the ball, 51 passes with three key passes, and four attempted dribbles. To make it even more damning for King, Willian had three tackles and three interceptions compared to King’s zero tackles and one interception. From this, you could understand why Ranieri subbed him out for Shinji Okazaki, effectively reverting to a 4-4-2.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Having a strike partner up front is just what Jamie Vardy ordered, having been isolated in leading the front line. As lethal a striker as he is, he is not as effective ploughing the line alone. He needs to feed off of a partner, or rather someone like Shinji Okazaki. The Japanese forward’s tireless work rate has been very much underrated over the years, especially since he doesn’t score too many goals. But he is the perfect foil for Vardy, occupying opposition defenders, allowing the Englishman to exploit the open space with his pace. Simply put, the 4-4-2 formation is Leicester’s identity, it’s what made them champions in the first place. However, this exercise of changing up the tactics is very much appreciated and will no doubt aid the club’s direction for next season.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">As Ranieri said himself, next season, they’ll probably start with the same formation and tactics, with a view of something different for those heady European nights. That is perhaps the most sensible way to approach next season’s campaign. It’s difficult to throw out one’s identity, especially if this particular identity is exactly what made them successful. Don’t forget, there’s no guarantee that a tactical change will reap the same reward, nor will sticking with the same one guarantee failure on the biggest stage. Therefore, it’s best to stick with something comfortable.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">There is actually a good example of a side that employs a 4-4-2 formation, both on the domestic front and the European front. Leicester City only need to look at one of the finalists of this season’s UEFA Champions League, Atlético Madrid. While the tactical setup is a wee bit different, not to mention the personnel available, the Foxes would do no harm in following the example of Los Rojiblancos.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">A few quality additions here and there to further deepen the squad depth - not to mention keeping world-class talents like Riyad Mahrez and N’Golo Kanté - is the most pressing concern for Leicester as they approach next season. Who knows? Maybe they’ll take the UEFA Champion’s League by storm, too. Their 5000-to-1 odds to win the Premier League didn’t stop them from pillaging, so why should the Champion’s League? I am definitely looking forward to what’s in store for the high-flying foxes next season, with hopes that this season’s exploits are only the first chapter of many more to come. Thank you, Leicester City, for giving us a season to remember.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Oh, one last thing.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Thank you, Tottenham Hotspur, for doing your part in finishing below my Arsenal for 21 straight years. I’m glad <em>some</em> good things never come to an end.</p></div>
