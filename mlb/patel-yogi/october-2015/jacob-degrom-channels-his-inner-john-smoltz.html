				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Not too long ago, a fellow by the name of John Smoltz stated that this 2015 Mets rotation is <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/13270849/john-smoltz-says-new-york-mets-rotation-way-better-atlanta-braves-1990s" target="_blank">far more talented than the Braves rotations of the 1990s</a>. You may have heard about the caliber of pitchers that were a part of that Atlanta staff. Each of those pitching staffs were led by the smartest pitcher to ever grace a baseball mound - Greg Maddux - the crafty-lefty who notoriously pitched away, away, away to expand the strike zone, and then would put batters away with his nasty circle-change - Tom Glavine - and the flame-throwing John Smoltz. All three of those pitchers have rightfully earned their spot in the Baseball Hall of Fame for their respective careers and abundant accolades. They had other players during those years to help fill out the back end of the rotation such as the injury-plagued Steve Avery (who was headed towards a Hall of Fame career if he hadn’t encountered shoulder problems), Kevin Millwood, Charlie Leibrandt, Danny Neagle, and Kent Mercker.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Now let’s look at the Mets rotation. They have Jacob deGrom, Matt Harvey, Noah Syndergaard, and Steven Matz as their young core. 42-year-old Bartolo Colón is there to answer questions and help through rough patches, much like the way Leibrandt did on the behalf of the Braves’ three young hurlers. Yes, the Mets’ young trio has more pure talent. But they don’t have a transcendent player like Maddux or a virtuoso-of-the-strike-zone like Glavine. Basically, the Mets lack great precision pitchers. Instead, they have flamethrowers with amazing secondary pitches. This is why - and, admittedly, out of unabashed bias - I have to pick the Braves rotations of the 1990s over any other rotation (present or past), regardless of how talented they are.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">What set Smoltz apart from Maddux and Glavine wasn’t his diverse arsenal of pitches, style of pitching, or pitching smarts; it was his drive, passion, and competitiveness when the lights were at their brightest and the stage was at its very biggest. If you don’t believe me, just watch how dominant he was in Game 7 of the 1991 World Series. He matched Jack Morris pitch for pitch at the biggest stage during the most important start of his young career that would be filled with more starts just like that one.</p></div>
				
				<div class="video_container"><iframe class="youtube_video" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l8cVMAuDDbA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Still don’t believe that he was the best in this rotation when it mattered the most? I’ll let his career stats do the talking: 15-4 with a 2.67 ERA in 209 postseason innings pitched. Every pitcher would kill for that stat line during the regular season. Smoltz simply, yet effectively elevated his game to another, better level when it mattered the most. He competed – even when he wasn’t a starter. He showed up for work even (and especially) when he was having shoulder and elbow problems and had to alter his arm slot. He competed when doctors told him he needed to have career-ending surgery.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">I honestly can’t praise John Smoltz enough for setting an example for young players everywhere, including Jacob DeGrom. In his autobiography, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Starting-Closing-Perseverance-Faith-More/dp/0062120565" target="_blank">Starting and Closing: Perseverance, Faith, and One More Year</a></em>, John Smoltz talks frankly about the hardships that he faced and how he overcame them both in his professional and personal life. Simply put, he is the greatest competitor that I know. I had an opportunity to speak to him once in 2011. I asked him about Glavine’s performance in Game 6 of the 1995 World Series and, just to tease something else out of him, I even asked him about the biggest regret of his career. He told me, as he’s said on many occasions, that his biggest regret was that they weren’t able to win more championships together. That’s the spirit of a true competitor.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">So who fits the “John Smoltz” personality for the Mets? Jacob deGrom. So much has been said about Matt Harvey being the best pitcher on this staff. Don’t get me wrong – I believe that he’s an ace, but I believe that deGrom is even better. deGrom wasn’t a highly touted prospect like Harvey. Nor was he believed to be the savior for New York. Harvey is “The Dark Knight” that Gotham needs, deGrom is the Joseph Levitt-Gordon character doing all the heavy lifting and saving when his city and team need him the most. Over the past two seasons, he’s gone 23-14 with a 2.61 ERA in 331.1 innings pitched. He also won the Rookie of the Year honor following his phenomenal campaign in 2014 (9-6, 2.69 ERA).</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This year, his second season in the senior circuit, he pitched a career-high 191 innings. He’s followed that up with 20 additional innings, and counting, in the postseason. He’s showed signs of fatigue. His fastball command was shaky against the Dodgers in Game 5 of the NLDS and then again in Game 3 of the NLCS against the Cubs. In both outings, he struggled in the first couple of innings, but he showed his competitive nature by adjusting and altering his game plan. That led to his team winning both of those games.</p></div>
				
				<div class="video_container"><iframe class="youtube_video" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TOQfijwbf7E" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">So far, deGrom is 3-0 with a 1.80 ERA through his first three career starts in the playoffs. Smoltz went 2-0 with a 1.52 ERA through his first four career starts in the playoffs (keep in mind that when Smoltz made his postseason debut, in 1991, there was no division series). So Smoltz went 2-0 with a 1.76 ERA and one complete game shutout in two NLCS starts, and then 0-0 with a 1.26 ERA in two World Series starts – including the famous duel against Jack Morris in Game 7 of that World Series. This is why his present-day comparison, Jacob deGrom, is in great company. He’s got that Smoltz-esque fiery, competitive beast inside of him. He wants the ball during the biggest moments. He wants his manager to trust him - and he’s given Terry Collins no reason not to. He’s shown that he will compete and give his team a chance to win, regardless of how tired his arm is.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This is why I know deep down inside he will be ready to pitch on short rest, come in the game during relief appearances, and do whatever it takes to help his team win this year’s World Series against the Kansas City Royals. Intangible things like heart, commitment, and willpower have no objective way to be measured, but the heart of a true competitor will always shine when the lights are the brightest and the stage is the biggest.</p></div>
