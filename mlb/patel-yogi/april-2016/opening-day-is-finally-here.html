				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Sunny skies and that smell of freshly-mowed lawn can mean only one thing: <em>It’s time for baseball</em>. Opening Day is finally upon us. That means every team and every player starts off with a clean slate, leaving the shattered dreams and the unparalleled highs of the 2015 season in the history books.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">From this point forward, every team will aspire to be the surprise team. And some of the Chosen Ones, like the Mets or Astros of 2015, will excite us all out of seemingly nowhere. Players young and old will look to copy Bryce Harper’s breakout season last year. Rookies, like Corey Seager of the Dodgers, will look to have an immediate impact the way Kris Bryant did for the Cubs a year ago. But most importantly, Opening Day will give fans a chance to celebrate the game they love so much.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">There’s vast amounts of history when it comes to Opening Day. It’s a day when baseball becomes “political.” It’s a moment in time when U.S. Presidents show off their pitching arsenal with the traditional first pitch. Hammerin’ Hank Aaron ignited the crowed at Riverfront Stadium as he hit homer number 714 with his first swing of the 1974 campaign against the Cincinnati Reds. In 1940, Bob Feller tossed the one and only no-hitter on Opening Day in Major League history against the Chicago White Sox. Ted “Teddy Ballgame” Williams was a career .449 hitter on Opening Day, and he had at least one hit in every Opening Day game he appeared in. However, Hall of Fame pitcher Phil “Knucksie” Niekro struggled in his nine Opening Day starts. He went 0-7 with a 7.31 ERA on the season’s first day throughout his career, which has become a feat that seems galaxies apart when compared to his career 318-267 win-loss record (with a 3.32 ERA) in non-Opening Day starts.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But Opening Day isn’t just about the players and teams. It’s about baseball fans all over the world. For me, Opening Day is a tradition where I do nothing but binge-watch baseball and cheer on my team, the Atlanta Braves. I sit in front of the T.V. and watch my Braves play while chomping down a pizza and chugging a bottle of Mountain Dew. It’s what I’ve done for the past 15 or so years.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">I can’t remember the last time I missed a Braves Opening Day game. I remember watching Jordan Schafer start his career with a homer against the 2008 World Series champs, the Philadelphia Phillies. The year after, Jason Heyward shocked Turner Field with his own 3-run shot to begin his career in the big leagues. I remember watching John Smoltz start on Opening Day years after he was forced into the bullpen because of various arm ailments.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">With the first pitch in Pittsburgh only minutes away, I wanted to preview and breakdown the three games we have on the ledger for today.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b><u>St. Louis Cardinals at Pittsburgh Pirates</u></b></p></div>
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PNC Park, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</p>
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">1:05 PM on ESPN</p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The Cards come into this season with high expectations. Last season, they finished the regular season with a 100-62 record in baseball’s closest division. Today, they travel to the Steel City to face the team that finished second, the Pittsburgh Pirates (98-64 record). Mike Matheny will rely upon his ace, Adam Wainwright, to go deep into the game. However, Clint Hurdle’s Pirates may have the upper hand in this one. Yesterday, Matheny expressed his discontent over the <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/st-louis-cardinals/post/_/id/451/cardinals-mike-matheny-wonders-about-cold-weather-scheduling" target="_blank">39-degree weather and gusty winds</a> that will be presiding today as Francisco Liriano opens up the season with the first pitch.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">As for Wainwright himself, who is coming off of an Achilles tendon injury, the pressure to perform at his Cy Young capabilities will be upon him from the moment the game begins. But the 34-year-old has used Spring Training to make some timely course-corrections. “All of a sudden, he’s learning how to work his sinker differently and he starts maximizing how he uses the plate with his cutter and he does that late in his career,” Matheny told <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/st-louis-cardinals/post/_/id/417/adam-wainwright-continues-to-adapt-and-thrive" target="blank">Mark Saxon</a> of ESPN.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">With his Achilles healed, Wainwright will be thrown into the vaunted <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/st-louis-cardinals/post/_/id/444/clubhouse-culture-the-real-secret-to-cardinals-success" target="_blank">“leadership core”</a> alongside Yadier Molina, Matt Holiday, and Matt Carpenter.  If the Cards want to retain their divisional throne and advance to the World Series again – a feat that will be made tougher thanks to their intra-divisional rivals Chicago Cubs and the even-year-happy-go-lucky San Francisco Giants – they will need to keep that leadership core healthy and producing at an All-Star level. St. Louis comes into this season with the one of the most important things money can’t buy: <em>experience</em>. Let’s hope that amounts to something.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b><u>Toronto Blue Jays at Tampa Bay Rays</u></b></p></div>
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">Tropicana Field, St. Petersburg, Florida</p>
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">4:05 PM on ESP2, RSN, SUN</p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The Jays had a season for the ages last year. But it ultimately fizzled out since the Royals played the better baseball down the stretch. This year, reigning AL MVP Josh Donaldson seems primed to excel. He’s also convinced that <a href="http://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/mlb/josh-donaldson-qa-going-win-now/" target="_blank">his teammates</a> will reciprocate, “We want to win, and we want to win now. It’s not, hey, we hope we do it this year. No. We’re going to win now.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The 80-82 Rays from 2015 were bottom-feeders in the AL East last season and despite Evan Longoria, Chris Archer, and Logan Forsythe leading the way, not much will change in 2016. Manager Kevin Cash has been seen <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/sports/baseball/rays/rays-sloppy-play-irks-manager-kevin-cash/2270956" target="_blank">making pleas throughout Spring Training</a> for his team to step up its collective determination and game. None of these are signs that the Rays will definitively have a lackluster season once again. Nothing is set in stone in a game like baseball. But these news stories coming out of the Rays camp aren’t exactly depicting an environment that is conducive to winning baseball, either.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Look for the Blue Jays and starter Marcus Stroman to get the easy win today.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b><u>New York Mets at Kansas City Royals</u></b></p></div>
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">Ewing M. Kauffman Stadium, Kansas City, Missouri</p>
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">8:37 PM on ESPN</p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Is there a more sinking feeling than watching your opponent from the previous season’s World Series get their grubby paws on their hard-earned rings? Well, that’s what Matt Harvey, David Wright, and company will be exposed to when they take on the Kansas City Royals in KC tonight. It will be a nationally televised event and you can be sure that the Mets will be aiming to spoiling the party.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Matt Harvey seems to have finally fought off his debilitating (and painful) <a href="http://nypost.com/2016/04/01/matt-harvey-has-demanded-worlds-attention-even-in-silence/" target="_blank">bladder infection</a> and will take the mound tonight in Kansas City. The Dark Knight had his best season last year (13-8, 189.1 innings, 2.71 ERA, and 188 K’s) and this year should fare even better. His arm feels as strong as it’s ever felt and the Mets have an offense that’s locked and loaded.</p></div>

				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Royals/photos/pb.35686273690.-2207520000.1459703893./10153509559878691/?type=3&theater" target="_blank">KANSAS CITY ROYALS FACEBOOK ACCOUNT</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The Royals spent the offseason ensuring that almost every member of their World Series-winning roster returned to the team. I say “almost every member” because they weren’t able to hold on to Johnny Cueto, who signed with the Giants via free agency. But Mike Moustakas, Alcides Escobar, and Eric Hosmer and the rest of the Royals squad remain intact. Don’t forget their experience, either; despite their youthful core, the Royals still have <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/stats/rosters/_/sort/average_age/order/true" target="_blank">one of the oldest rosters</a> in baseball, which will go a long way as the baseball season rolls into the dog days of the summer.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">So, are you ready for some baseball?</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">We all have our own traditions and memories for Opening Day that you share with your friends and family. I know everyone is excited to cheer on his or her teams despite what happened in 2015. I wish your team the best of luck as we begin the 2016 season. But most importantly…Go Braves!</p></div>
