				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Trevor Story and Robinson Canó have both started this MLB season with a bang. While Canó’s average isn’t where he would like it to be (.189), five of his seven hits have found the seats. Story, in a similar vein, has hit seven homers in his first eight big league games. While we’re only in the second week of a long season, neither one appears to be on the verge of slowing down any time soon. Story has shown his remarkable plate coverage, and we already know how great of a hitter Canó can be when he’s healthy. So it got me thinking, “What are the ten best first-halves in recent history?”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>10. Alex Rodriguez, Seattle Mariners - 2000</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">First-half stats: .365/.439/.639, 24 HR, 78 RBI</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">A-Rod had 109 hits in the first half of the season in just 316 at-bats. He also scored 84 runs and had a freakishly crazy .366 BAbip (batting average on balls in play), 110 tOPS+, and 169 sOPS+. He would “cool down” in the second half (.277/.394/.563, 17 HR, 54 RBIs), but not before posting a WAR of 6.0 prior to the All-Star break. At the very least, this scintillating start to his 2000s showed just how consistent A-Rod has always been.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>9. José Bautista, Toronto Blue Jays - 2011</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">First-half stats: .334/.468/.702, 31 HR, 65 RBI</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Coming off of a 54-homer campaign, Bautista continued his power barrage into the first half of the 2011 season. He posted a 226 sOPS+ and a WAR of 5.8 in the first half. He led the senior circuit in home runs, slugging percentage, on-base percentage, and WAR going into the All-Star break. He finished the season with 43 homers and third in the AL MVP ballot.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>8. Miguel Cabrera, Detroit Tigers - 2013</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">First-half stats: .365/.458/.674, 30 HR, 95 RBI</p></div>
				
				<img src="apr-mlb-article-images/miggy.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a href="http://media.mlive.com/detroit/photo/2014/08/02/-e26792d65e216654.JPG" target="_blank">WWW.MLIVE.COM</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Miguel Cabrera is one of the best, if not the best, hitter of this generation. What he did in the first half of 2013 shouldn’t come as a surprise. He had a .378 BAbip, a tOPS+ of 110, and a sOPS+ of 213. Not to mention, his ability to drive in runs and on-base percentage helped him have a 206 wRC+ and a WAR of 5.8. He slowed down in the second half, but his first-half surge was the primary reason he took home his second consecutive AL MVP award.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>7. Zack Greinke, Kansas City Royals - 2009</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">First-half stats: 10-5, 2.12 ERA</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This Royals team was a mess and Greinke was the only bright spot. He led all the pitchers with a 5.6 WAR and boasted a 2.00 FIP. He also threw five complete games and two shutouts and had a 9.1 K/9 rate. However, he couldn’t keep up the 2.00 FIP, but he stayed just as dominant in the second half and earned the AL Cy Young award that year.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>6. Barry Bonds, San Francisco Giants - 2002</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">First-half stats: .345/.562/.780, 27 HR, 57 RBI</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Heading into that year, Bonds was fresh off of his 73-homer campaign and pitchers were avoiding him at all costs. By the All-Star break, the steroid-supplementing slugger had drawn 109 walks compared to just 28 strikeouts. He posted a 258 sOPS+, 6.6 WAR, and a 234 wRC+. He would keep that trend the same in the second half and, in the process, win another NL MVP award.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>5. Frank Thomas, Chicago White Sox - 1994</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">First-half stats: .383/.516/.795, 32 HR, 78 RBI</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">That’s a stat line any player would want to have over the course of a season. Many players got off to hot starts in the 1994 season, but Thomas led the senior circuit with a 6.4 WAR and 228 wRC+ prior to the All-Star Break. His power disappeared in the second half as he only hit six more long balls. But thanks in large part to his menacing first half, he would edge out a player by the name of Ken Griffey, Jr. en route to his second consecutive AL MVP honors.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>4. Roger Clemens, Boston Red Sox - 1988</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">First-half stats: 12-5, 2.42 ERA</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Imagine pitching at the same time as the strikeout king, Nolan Ryan. Now imagine having more strikeouts than Ryan heading into the All-Star break. In 1988, that’s exactly what Clemens did. He led the league with 186 strikeouts, a 10.5 K/9 rate, and had the fifth-best walk rate at 1.6/9 (28 walks). He also threw eight complete games, including six shutouts. Along with that, he was showing how effective he was at getting hitters out himself by posting a 1.77 FIP. That first half, Clemens was worth 6.9 wins above replacement. However, he faltered in the second half, posting a listless 6-7 record to go along with a sky-high 3.71 ERA.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>3. Randy Johnson, Arizona Diamondbacks - 2000</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">First-half stats: 14-2, 1.80 ERA</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Forget the win-loss record for a minute so we can see how The Big Unit truly dominated the first half of the 2000 season. By May 16th, through his ninth start of the year, Johnson had posted a 0.97 ERA. Eight of those outings included double-digit punch-outs. For the entire first half, The Big Unit struck out 198 batters for a K/9 rate of 12.3, while walking a meager 2.24 per nine. He threw five complete games and two shutouts while posting a FIP of 2.39 and a WAR of 5.9. He would struggle after the All-Star break, but he still ended up striking out a whopping 347 batters en route to another NL Cy Young award.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>2. Barry Bonds, San Francisco Giants - 2004</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">First-half stats: .365/.628/.794, 23 HR, 48 RBI</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">When looking at his 2004 first-half numbers, you have to wonder how his on-base percentage is so high. Well, pitchers were often threatened by Bonds, so they opted to simply walk him and avoid the impending long ball. By the All-Star break, Bonds had drawn 131 walks, including 71 intentional walks. Oh, and he only struck out 19 times. He reached base via a walk 40 percent of the time! He had a sOPS+ of 274, a WAR of 6.1, and was credited with 233 wRC+. That’s a pretty impressive first half for anyone, so it’s no surprise that he went on to win his seventh NL MVP award that year.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>1. Pedro Martínez, Boston Red Sox - 1999</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">First-half stats: 15-3, 2.10 ERA</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Perhaps the best first-half performance in the history of the game, Pedro was nothing short of filthy. Martínez posted a 1.48 FIP during the first half while getting hitters to fan 184 times, good for a K/9 rate of 12.5. He only walked 24 of the 522 batters he faced. His first-half WAR was 7.3 – nearly two wins above Randy Johnson, who was having a Cy Young year himself. Martínez would be even more dominant in the second half, going 8-1 with a 2.01 ERA and striking out 14.4 batters per nine innings. Did I mention he was pitching in the hitter-friendly AL that housed the Bronx Bombers and those other dangerous lineups? It’s no surprise that Pedro Martínez comes in at number one on this list.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">While Trevor Story and Robinson Canó have a long way to go before cracking this list, they are off to great starts. The only question is, can they keep it up? <a href="https://twitter.com/thesportswhorl" target="_blank">Send us</a> your first-half predictions for players that are off to hot starts and we can revisit this list after this year’s All-Star break concludes in San Diego.</p></div>
