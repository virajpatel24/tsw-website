				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">We’ve watched nearly a month of baseball and there’s been many intriguing storylines. For example, Trevor Story got off to a hot start to begin his career. However, there are a few players, like Zack Greinke, who will be happy to see the month flip, hoping that their numbers come back to a familiar range. I would not be overly concerned about these slow starts because we all know they have the talent to bounce back and put up numbers that are consistent with the numbers you see on the back of their baseball cards. Here are six players – excluding players like Jason Heyward that typically get off to dawdling starts – that are off to extremely slow starts.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>1. Zack Greinke, Arizona Diamondbacks</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">When the Dbacks signed Greinke to his massive six-year, $206.5 million contract, they did not expect him to get off to such a rough start. But through his first five starts, he’s gone 2-2 with a 6.16 ERA, and he has already given up five home runs. He only gave up fourteen homers in 222.2 innings last year. He has struggled more this year because of a .333 BABIP. Last year, his BABIP sat at .229. But players are getting more hits off of him and they’re making contact on 91.3% of the pitches that are thrown inside the strike zone compared to a meager 10.5% swing-and-miss rate. He’s also suffered from many weakly-hit balls – he’s already surrendered six infield hits compared to only giving up twelve all of last season. His FIP (fielding independent pitching) is also sitting at a sky-high 4.25, which lies in stark contrast with the 2.76 FIP he posted last year. While Greinke might not have the same season as he did a year ago, he will certainly still put up numbers that are in line with his career stats. He’s been pitching great on the road. It’s just a matter of time before he brings that success to Chase Field.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>2. Anthony Rendon, Washington Nationals</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">With Bryce Harper and Daniel Murphy off to such hot starts, Rendon’s .229/.289/.277 stat line gets readily overlooked. So when you look at that slash line you would think that Rendon is heading towards an uncharacteristically terrible season. However, his strikeout rate is a measly 12.2% (15.2% in his breakout 2014 season) and his hard-hit ball percentage is 36.1%. So he’s hitting on par with his 2014 season, but the results just have not been there yet. If (or when) Harper and Murphy ever come back to earth, Rendon should be ready to carry the load.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>3. Joey Votto, Cincinnati Reds</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">April 2016 is by far the worst month of Votto’s career. He’s hitting .221/.311/.312. He only has one homerun and eleven RBIs this month. The biggest reason behind his struggles is that he is walking far less (11.1%) and striking out a lot more (23.3%).</p></div>
				
				<img src="apr-mlb-article-images/votto.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Reds/photos/pb.44027083759.-2207520000.1461952915./10154181575833760/" target="_blank">CINCINNATI REDS FACEBOOK ACCOUNT</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">His BABIP is .268, and he has pulled the ball 46.7% of the time. Also, in 25 plate appearances in which defenses have shifted against him, Votto is hitting .167 with a BABIP of .160. In the 33 plate appearances in which defenses have not shifted against him, he’s hitting .344 with a BABIP of .333. Given his track record, he’s just a couple of weeks away from turning the page on this horrendous month. Give him time.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>4. José Fernández, Miami Marlins</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">So far this season, Fernández sports a 2-2 record with a 4.08 ERA through his first five starts. All of his numbers are around the same area as his career numbers, so it is just rust from Tommy John surgery in 2014 and shoulder ailments from last season that have led to Fernandez’s early season struggles. Aside from his start against the Giants, he has pitched effectively with better results – including his start against the Dodger at Chavez Ravine last night when he went six innings on 89 pitches while spraying 8 K’s on a fairly <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/stats/team/_/stat/batting/sort/strikeouts/type/expanded/order/true" target="_blank">strikeout-prone</a> Dodger lineup.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>5. David Price, Boston Red Sox</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">When you pay a pitcher $217 million, you do not expect him to start the season with a 5.76 ERA. Despite his ERA being astronomically high, he is 3-0. Hitters are hitting the ball hard off of Price 41.1% of the time. This mark should regress to the mean since hitters have hit the ball hard off of him only 27% of the time during his career. Hitters have also started ambushing the first pitch off of Price, and they have hit it hard. But despite how many hard hits opponents are getting off of him, he has a K/9 rate of 13.96 and a FIP of 2.44. That means David Price will be in contention for another AL Cy Young Award by the time the season ends.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>6. Adam Wainwright, St. Louis Cardinals</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Waino has a 1-3 record and a 7.13 ERA through his first five starts this year. As a Waino fan, it’s been tough to watch his starts, but you have to remember he suffered a ruptured Achilles and made a quick recovery. His stuff is still there, but he just hasn’t been able to locate it as well as we’re accustomed to seeing him locate his pitches. He has left a lot of pitches over the plate and he does not have that late sinking action on his fastball right now, but over the next two to three starts, I believe that will change. In a month or so, we will see the Waino we are all used to seeing.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Other notable players that will bounce back include: Lorenzo Cain, Miguel Cabrera (even though he’s been on a tear lately), and Kyle Seager.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">As for <a href="https://soundcloud.com/the-sports-whorl-podcast/ep-57-mlb-w-yogi-patel-viraj-patel-and-matt-dengler#t=26m2s" target="_blank">Shelby Miller</a>, I’m not sure what to expect from him. He has been an effective pitcher throughout his big league career. He had a breakout season with the Braves last year. However, he has always walked a ton of hitters, his fastball velocity has dropped, and his mechanics have been way out of whack this year. His four-seam fastball sits around 93-94 MPH, and his two-seamer and cutter range from 89-91 MPH. Last year, his four-seamer was between 94-96 MPH, occasionally topping out at 97-98 MPH, and his two-seamer and cutter sat between 92-94 MPH. I believe that he is trying to compensate for the loss of velocity by overexerting himself on his delivery. The results are poor, as he’s missing badly with his fastball and hitters are slugging .570 off of him. Mechanical issues take much longer to iron out than just hitting or pitching into bad luck, so I do not think he will have the type of season the Dbacks envisioned he would when they traded away a king’s ransom to get him.</p></div>
