				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“In a world that made sense, Alex Rodriguez would be the symbol of Latin ascendance over the game of baseball.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Allen Barra, sportswriter</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">It feels like ages ago when an 18-year-old phenom by the name of Alex Rodriguez raced through the Seattle Mariners farm system and changed the shortstop position. Generally, shortstops were thought of as defense-first, contact guys with good speed. However, A-Rod was a rare breed; he brought power to the position like no one had done before.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In 1994, A-Rod hit .204/.241/.204 in 54 at-bats. The next season, he hit .232/.264/.408 with five homers in 142 at-bats. But 1996 would be A-Rod’s coming out party. That season, he hit .358/.414/.631 with 36 homers and 123 RBIs en route to his first All-Star selection and Silver Slugger award. He would finish second in the AL MVP voting that year. Mariners fans had plenty to be excited about. Hall-of-Famer Ken Griffey Jr. and A-Rod were set to become unforgiving menaces for opposing pitchers for many years to come.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But, in reality, Griffey was oft-injured and as good as Rodriguez was during the regular season, his numbers were the complete opposite during the postseason. Over his career, he’s hit an abysmal .259/.365/.457 in 278 at-bats over a span of 76 postseason games. And in those 278 at-bats, he only hit 13 homers with 41 RBIs, while whiffing a whopping 77 times.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“The sky’s the limit with Alex. He is a natural.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Ken Griffey, Jr., former Mariners teammate and Hall-of-Famer</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“We knew Alex had a lot of potential, but I don’t think people were expecting all this.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Edgar Martinez, former Mariners teammate</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“Every big leaguer should aspire to be like Alex Rodriguez.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Mike Hargrove, former Mariners manager</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Despite his anemic postseason numbers, he became a player destined for Cooperstown during his seven years in Seattle. He would end his Mariners tenure with an impressive .309/.374/.561 slash line, 189 homers, 595 RBIs, and 133 stolen bases. Additionally, he led the Mariners to the playoffs in three of those seasons, and onto the ALCS during two of those postseason runs.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">After the 2000 season, Rodriguez ran towards the money. And who could blame him? Would <em>you</em> turn down the 10-year, $252 million offer that the Texas Rangers threw at him that winter? The Rangers had finished in fourth place in the AL West that year after back-to-back first place finishes. But as their young sensation prepared to don the blue Rangers uniforms, the Mariners felt betrayed. Rodriguez had claimed up to that point that he wanted to stay in Emerald City and be a part of a competitive team. By signing with the Mariners’ division rivals, he broke Seattle’s heart as he stormed his way down south.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“Alex is the player we believe will allow this franchise to continue its dream to become a World Series champion.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Tom Hicks, former Texas Rangers owner</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“He’s not afraid to pull people aside if they’re not pulling their weight.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Johnny Oates, former Rangers manager</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Despite the Rangers’ best attempts, a World Series ring was just not meant to be. Rodriguez’s new club failed to make the playoffs every season he was there. Heck, even finishing a season with a .500 record was a Herculean task for that Rangers squad. But for A-Rod, it was all for personal gain. He chased the money to Texas while the Mariners went on the make the playoffs for the next three seasons without him.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“He’s the best player in the game.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Rafael Palmeiro, former Rangers teammate</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“He is without a doubt the best player in baseball, but I only hope that someday he might be as a good a player as he is a person.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Jerry Narron, former Rangers manager</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But his time in Texas put him in a conversation reserved for a select few. His Rangers teammates lauded his talent. He hit .305/.395/.615 with 156 HR and drove in 395 RBI over three seasons in a Rangers uniform. He was selected as an All-Star in each of those years. He also collected his first AL MVP award in 2003 when he hit .298/.396/.600 with 47 homers and 118 RBI. Considering that was a “down” year compared to his 2002 campaign (.300/.392/.623 with 57 homers and 142 RBIs), it was easy to claim that Mr. Rodriguez was living up to his big-money contract.</p></div>

				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="https://robtringali.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/0044934.jpg" target="_blank">WWW.ROBTRINGALI.COM</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">2001 was an interesting year for the slugger. During Spring Training, Rodriguez sparked up controversy with one of the game’s most popular figures: Derek Jeter. In an interview for Esquire, he said:</p></div>		
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><em>“Jeter’s been blessed with great talent around him. He’s never had to lead. He can just go and play and have fun. And he hits second – that’s totally different than third and fourth in a lineup. You go into New York, you wanna stop Bernie and O’Neill. You never say, ‘Don’t let Derek beat you.’ He’s never your concern.”</em></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Later he confirmed his comments to the Associated Press, but went on to defend himself by saying his words did not reflect his intent:</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><em>“It’s my mistake because I said it. How can I ever dog Derek Jeter? It’s impossible. There is nothing to knock. He’s a great defensive player. He’s a great offensive player. He’s one of the top three players in the game, for the greatest team of my era.”</em></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">However, the damage had been done. Derek Jeter was evolving into the face of baseball. He had already collected four World Series Championship rings for the most historic franchise in baseball. Meanwhile, Rodriguez, a vastly greater regular season player, had repeatedly failed to show up during the postseason, or even lead his current team into the postseason. They both played the same position, but went about it in diametrically opposing ways.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“The way he’s going, someday he might bat .400 and hit 60 home runs.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Dan Duquette, Former Red Sox GM</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">After three failed seasons for the Texas Rangers, the organization decided it was time to ship Alex Rodriguez and his massive contract off elsewhere and start over. They had young rising superstar-caliber players in Mark Teixeira and Michael Young, and they felt that Rodriguez did not fit into their clubhouse anymore.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In December of 2003, a massive blockbuster, franchise-altering trade was in place between the Rangers and the Boston Red Sox. Texas would send Rodriguez to Boston in return for the slugging sensation called Manny Ramirez. But in order to make this trade happen, A-Rod’s contract would have to be restructured. In the end, that trade combusted when the union disapproved of the restructuring.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">On January 16th, 2004, Aaron Boone, most famously known for his heroics during the 2003 ALCS vs. Boston, tore his ACL in his left knee while playing a pickup game of basketball. In one fell swoop, the Bronx Bombers lost their third basemen, which left a sizeable hole in their projected lineup.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">On January 25th 2004, then Rangers owner Tom Hicks said, “There is no possibility (A-Rod) will be traded. It looked like a possibility at one time. It didn’t work out. We’re going to put it behind us.” Later that day, Rodriguez was named the captain of the Rangers. It looked like he was being given a second chance with his current team.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“I think there’s always going to be some doubt until he does something [special] to be accepted at the pinstriped gates and into the pinstriped corral.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Reggie Jackson, Yankees legend and Hall-of-Famer</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“He really is one of the best players in the big leagues.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Jorge Posada, former Yankees teammate</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“He comes to work with more tools in the box than anybody in the game.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Reggie Jackson</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But on February 16th 2004, two franchises would drastically change forever. The New York Yankees shipped second basemen Alfonso Soriano to the Texas Rangers in return for Alex Rodriguez. It was by far the biggest trade in Rangers history and one of the biggest trades in Yankees history. Upon arriving to the Bronx, A-Rod was told that he would have to change his uniform number (Rodriguez’s number 3 from his Texas days was already retired by the Yankees, in honor of another franchise-changer named Babe Ruth) and positions (four-time World Series champion and captain Derek Jeter was hell-bent on keeping his shortstop position). The next day, during the introductory press conference, A-Rod donned the famous pinstripes uniform with the number emblazoned 13 on the back. He also added that he would be shifting over to third base.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><em>“I have come to a point in my career where winning is the most important thing. It was team over personal. This energizes me. I don’t have enough adjectives to describe how I feel. Derek has four world championships and I want him to have 10. We’re going to make a great tag team.”</em></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">He began his tenure with the Bombers with a bang. He finished the 2004 season hitting .286/.375/.512, with 36 long balls and 106 runs batted in. He extended that success into the postseason when he hit .320/.414/.600 alongside six homers that eventually ended when that year’s historic Boston Red Sox team overcame a 3-0 deficit during the ALCS and went on the win the World Series to end the “Curse of the Great Bambino.” A-Rod was also involved in the controversial “slap play” that caused them to lose Game 6 of the ALCS. In the decisive Game 7 of the ALCS, he went 0-4. This was a trend that plagued Rodriguez.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In 2005, Rodriguez went 0-4 in Game 5 of the ALDS against the Angels. In his postgame press conference, he ruefully said, “I played great baseball all year. I played like a dog the last five games.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But that 2005 season was highlighted by the fact that Rodriguez spent his time by visiting New York City poker parlors. Despite winning his second AL MVP Award that year, the Yankees raised their eyebrows and wondered whether A-Rod was focused on winning or not.</p></div>

				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="http://feelgrafix.com/data_images/out/18/923440-alex-rodriguez.jpg" target="_blank">WWW.FEELGRAFIX.COM</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">2006 was again full of negatives for A-Rod. During a brutal 12-2 beating on August 17th in Baltimore, Rodriguez and Jeter collided when running for a routine pop up in the sixth inning and neither caught the ball, which allowed the runner from second to score. Jeter gave Rodriguez a blistering glare after the play.  To make matters even worse, Rodriguez, again, graced the cover of Sports Illustrated in September. However, this time the cover headline read “The Lonely Yankee,” and it included harsh comments from teammate Jason Giambi.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">As if that wasn’t enough, Joe Torre, Yankees manager at the time, demoted Rodriguez to the eighth spot in the lineup during Game 4 of the ALDS against the Detroit Tigers. The Tigers went on to win the game 8-3 and Rodriguez went on to reaffirm, “I certainly don’t want to go anywhere. I want to finish my career in New York.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">2007 was yet another challenging year. As much as everyone thought A-Rod had mended his relationship with Jeter by shifting over to third and saying he would be more “team oriented,” he let out the worst-kept secret: He and Jeter were not friends. On February 19th, he met with reporters in Tampa and said, “It is what it is. People are just assuming that things are a lot worse than what they are. They’re not. But obviously, it’s not as good as it used to be, when we were blood brothers. Let’s make a contract. You don’t ask about Derek anymore, and I promise I’ll stop lying to you.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">He continued his trend of regular season dominance and postseason struggles. He was also seen in public in Toronto with a blonde woman who was not his wife. Reports later revealed that she was a stripper named Joslyn Morse. Boston jeered him ruthlessly later that season.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“To do it at home, wearing this beautiful uniform, it’s special. You know, I’ve had my trials and tribulations here in New York. I’ve learned from them. I’ve had some great times and some tough times. But a day like this kind of brings it full circle and maybe there’s a happy ending for me somewhere.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Alex Rodriguez</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">However, on August 4th, he slugged homer number 500 off of Royals pitcher Kyle Davies, becoming the youngest player ever to reach that milestone. That monumental achievement and his third AL MVP Award were just a couple of the bright spots in a challenging season for the slugger.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">While the Red Sox and Colorado Rockies were facing off in the World Series, Rodriguez stole the spotlight. During Game 4, he announced that he was going to opt out of his contract. Then on December 13th, he reached an agreement with the Yankees for a 10-year $275 million deal while admitting that he made a mistake and handled his opt-out poorly.  To add even more controversy, the Mitchell Report was released that same day and Rodriguez’s name wasn’t amongst the names revealed. Jose Canseco, a PED user who was revealed in the report, claimed that the report was incomplete and that he was shocked that Rodriguez’s name wasn’t mentioned in the report. A few days later, Rodriguez did an interview for “60 Minutes” with Katie Couric in which he denied the use of PEDs and said, “I’ve never felt overmatched on the baseball field.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Still ticked off by the Mitchell Report and Canseco’s comments, the following spring training Rodriguez said, “I have no concerns. Right now, the game is in a very non-trusting situation with the public and our fans. Some of the things that I have accomplished - and potentially some of the things that people think I can accomplish - my name has come up and will probably come up again in the future. It is what it is." But Canseco remained firm in his journey to exploit Rodriguez. Before his book – “Vindicated” – was released, portions were revealed on the Internet in a report by Joe Lavin. Canseco was confident that Rodriguez took steroids and even said that he did everything but inject the guy himself. This PED story would haunt Rodriguez all season long. In the end, A-Rod and the Yankees failed to make the playoffs for the first time in 14 years.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">On February 9th, 2009 all hell broke loose. According to a Sports Illustrated report, A-Rod had tested positive for Primobolan and synthetic testosterone in 2003, a season that earned him his first AL MVP award. He also had a falling out with his cousin, Yuri Sucart, who had supplied the PEDs from the Dominican Republic.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">“I did take a banned substance, and for that I'm very sorry and deeply regretful,” Alex Rodriguez told ESPN’s Peter Gammons on a live televised interview. “When I arrived in Texas in 2001, I felt an enormous amount of pressure. I felt like I had all the weight of the world on top of me, and I needed to perform -- and perform at a high level -- every day. Back then, it was a different culture. It was very loose. I was young, I was stupid, I was naïve. I wanted to prove to everyone that I was worth being one of the greatest players of all-time. I did take a banned substance, and for that I’m very sorry. I’m deeply regretful. I’m sorry for that time, I’m sorry to my fans, I’m sorry to my fans in Texas. It wasn’t until then that I ever thought about substances of any kind. Since then, I’ve proved to myself and to everyone that I don’t need any of that.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">There were players out there that were ready to forgive Rodriguez, including teammate Derek Jeter:</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><em>“I know he’s very, very sorry. It’s a difficult thing to do. Everybody makes mistakes, but it’s probably pretty difficult to have to address it publicly in front of the whole country. We’re here to support him through it. We don’t condone what he did. Alex doesn’t condone what he did. At this point now, it’s our job to help him be as comfortable as he can on the field and try to move past this. I’ve said it time and time again – we’re here to support him through it as a teammate, the same thing as with Andy [Pettitte] last year and with Jason [Giambi] a few years ago. I get tired of hearing about things with our relationship. That’s an old story. Regardless of what I do, people are going to have their opinions, but I get tired of hearing it.”</em></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Other baseball stars around the country also offered their show of support for a wounded Rodriguez, who had lost more than his pride and reputation with that public admission.</p></div>

				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“I support Alex 100 percent. He admitted he made a mistake. Obviously, I don’t condone anything like that, but as far as I’m concerned he’s still my friend. I’m going to show support in good times and bad.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Michael Young</p>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">A few players, like Roy Oswalt and Alex Rios, justifiably disagreed.</p></div>

				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">To make a challenging offseason even worse, Rodriguez underwent hip surgery on March 9th and wouldn’t play in a game until May 8th. And on the first pitch he saw, he turned it around for a three-run shot off of Jeremy Guthrie at Camden Yards.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The 2009 season would be one to remember, not just because of the negatives, but also of what he accomplished that season. He hit .286/.402/.532, with 30 homers and 100 RBIs. He carried that success into the postseason where he hit .365/.500/.808, with six homers and 18 RBIs. He led the Yankees to their 27th World Series title and his first ring. There was no better end to a season that was full of challenges and difficulties for the slugger.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">2010 seemed like it would be a season where people would talk about whether A-Rod and the Yankees could defend their title, but reports broke out about Toronto physician Anthony Galea and Rodriguez. Galea was under federal investigation for alleged drug violations. However, Galea asserted that he had only treated Rodriguez with anti-inflammatories. Rodriguez would meet with MLB investigators and claim that he never received PEDs from him. But the highlight of his 2010 season was hitting his 600th homer. “For me, the perspective of hitting 600 home runs, it feels really good. But when you win a World Series - which is what I worked my whole life for - no personal achievement can compare to celebrating on the mound and being the last team standing.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">His 2010 and 2011 seasons both ended in the same fashion: he struck out to end the Yankees’ postseason runs. In 2012, things got worse for Rodriguez when manager Joe Girardi pinch-hit Raul Ibanez for him during the bottom of the ninth inning against the Orioles. The Yankees trailed by only one run and Ibanez drilled the pitch into the seats, tying the game. He later ended the game with a walk-off homer in the bottom of the 12th. A-Rod said after the game, “I’m one of the leaders of this team. Maybe 10 years ago I react a much different way, but I’m at a place in my career right now where team means everything. I don’t think there was anybody in the ballpark more excited for Raul than me.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Rodriguez was then benched for Endy Chavez in Game 5 of the ALDS against the Orioles. “Obviously, I’m not happy and obviously I’m disappointed. You want to be in there in the worst way. But I keep telling you, this is not a story about one person, it’s about a team and we have some unfinished business today. Our objective is to win one game and keep this thing moving.” They would win that game and face the Tigers in the ALCS.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">A-Rod would get benched again during Game 3 of the ALCS and the Yankees were eventually get swept by the Tigers. “This was a terrible way for the season to end. Obviously we’re all very disappointed. You’re crushed; you work eight months to get to this point. I know there are a lot of teams that would love to get in this position in the ALCS with an opportunity to go to the World Series, but we just came up short.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">On December 3rd, Brian Cashman announced that A-Rod would undergo his second hip surgery. To further complicate Rodriguez’s career, reports revealed association between Rodriguez and Anthony Bosch, who was a former Florida medical clinic owner who had posed as a doctor while illegally supplying steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs to athletes at both the professional and amateur levels. On the other hand, tension was rising between Cashman and Rodriguez. Rodriguez kept going around team protocol and Cashman was not thrilled - to say the least - about his antics. It led him to tell ESPN that A-Rod should “shut the f--- up!” Rodriguez was also being mentally drained by the new PED scandal that had risen.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“None of his good deeds on the field have any sustainability. All that lingers are his mounting malfunctions.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Joel Sherman, sportswriter</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">On August 5th, Rodriguez was penalized a record 211 games by Bud Selig for violating Basic Agreement and baseball’s drug program. But Rodriguez would appeal. “There is nothing about this that has been easy. All of it has been challenging. I’m sure there have been mistakes made along the way. We’re here now. I’m a human being. I am fighting for my life. I have to defend myself. If I don’t defend myself, no one else will.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The arbitration was long and tiring for Rodriguez. It was later revealed in <em>The Daily News</em> that A-Rod paid $305,000 for Biogenesis Reports. Finally on January 11th, 2014, arbitrator Frederic Horowitz’s ruling was announced: 162 games plus the 2014 postseason.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">That wasn’t the worst part of Rodriguez’s day. He received an email from his friend José saying he needed to talk to him and that it was urgent. Rodriguez immediately called him and heard the unexpected: his father had passed away that same day. He hadn’t talked to his father in many years and they weren’t that close. After all, his father did break Alex’s heart when he was just nine years old.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Victor Rodriguez, Alex’s father, introduced Alex to the game he would come to love with all of his heart. They had a great relationship. Rodriguez once said, “He had been so good to me, actually spoiled me because I was the baby of the family. I couldn’t understand what he had done.” What Victor had done was walk out on his family when Alex was just nine years old.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><em>“Dad left us when I was 9. What did I know back then? I thought he was coming back. I thought he had gone to the store or something. But he never came back. It still hurts. To this day, I still don’t really know how a man could do that to his family: turn his back. After a while, I lied to myself. I tried to tell myself that it didn’t matter, that I didn’t care. But times I was alone, I often cried. Where was my father? To this day, I still can’t get close to people.”</em></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Rodriguez and his siblings leaned on their mother, Lourdes Navarro. She instilled the heart, hustle, and work ethic that we’ve seen from Rodriguez in his tender heart.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But when the Seattle Mariners drafted Rodriguez in 1993, Victor reached out to him.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><em>“I didn’t even know where he was calling from. I didn’t know what to think. It was nice, but it didn’t make much impression on me, not after all that time.”</em></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">It brought some hope into A-Rod’s life. Rodriguez once said in an interview, “I kept looking for him to show up, somewhere, somehow. I wondered what it would be like, what he would look like, what he would say...what I would say.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The pain of his father walking out on his family never subsided through the intervening years. Now, the game he loved dearly was being snatched away from him by MLB. And to find out that his father had passed away before the two could mend their relationship? Alex Rodriguez felt more alone than ever. The universe was clearly against him.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">How would he respond? What would he play like with nearly a year and a half away from baseball? Would he still be a Yankee? There were so many questions surrounding Rodriguez. The Yankees weren’t even guaranteeing him any playing time. Girardi told A-Rod he would have to earn back his playing time. And Rodriguez did just that. He came back with a bang in 2015. As a 40-year-old, Rodriguez was nothing but the Yankees DH. And he did nothing but produce. He ended the 2015 campaign by hitting .250/.356/.486, with 33 homers and 86 RBIs. However, he struggled once again in the postseason, going 0-4 in the Wild Card game against the Houston Astros.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Despite his success, he is mostly thankful for the second chance. “I’m grateful for the way the commissioner [Rob Manfred] welcomed me back. Obviously the [Yankees’] management and ownership group was incredibly gracious. It was great to be back in the clubhouse with my teammates and the fans were just incredible to me . . . It was fun just focusing on baseball and no distractions. For me, it was actually a lot of fun being the old man in the room.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">His year away from baseball was a paradigm-shifter.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><em>“One of the things I focused on a lot serving my suspension was the impact my actions had on other people. Just the responsibilities for my actions. I spent a lot of time thinking about that. I’m a better teammate now, a better father, a better friend, a better partner in business. Really, everything.”</em></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">He has done just that. He has embraced his new role as a DH and as a mentor for younger baseball players. He has really evolved as a player and as a person. Going into this season, he isn’t too far behind Babe Ruth’s 714 homers and there are many other milestones that are in his striking distance, but that doesn’t matter as much to him now. These days, he has a team-first mindset: He wants to help the Yankees earn another ring. He is more humble, as can be seen by his subtle <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/15051882/alex-rodriguez-new-york-yankees-retire-2017-season" target="_blank">retirement announcement</a> last week. He showed his gratefulness when the Yankees honored his 3,000th hit:</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><em>“That’s one of the best days in my career because I got on the field with my mother and my two daughters, and that’s the first time that’s ever happened. That’s a day I’ll never forget.”</em></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Again, when ESPN interviewed him just a week ago, Rodriguez said, “I get treated better today than before my screw-ups. That is hard to believe and it is hard to comprehend sometimes, but I’m grateful for it.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">We are grateful for your second chance as well, A-Rod. Whatever lies ahead for Alex Rodriguez, he has earned a soft spot in my heart. The man’s passion and obsession was taken away from him for a year, and it led him to evolve into someone we all can look up to. I hope, in these final two seasons, Alex Rodriguez can continue to be the man we see today, a man that’s at peace with his harrowing past and optimistic about his evergreen future.</p></div>
