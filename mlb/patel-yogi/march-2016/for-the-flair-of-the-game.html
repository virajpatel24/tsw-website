				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“There's a bunch of cameras out there right now waiting to make a joke of this, Mick. So you can either stop, give them the sound bite, do the dance. Or you can hold your head up and walk by, and the next time we're in Boston, we'll go out there and work the wall together. Don't help them make a joke out of you.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">—  Billy Chapel, played by Kevin Costner in the 1999 film <em>“For the Love of the Game”</em></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">For a year and a half, Ryan Braun denied using PEDs during his 2011 MVP season. He finally admitted to using a cream and a lozenge that contained banned substances while rehabbing an injury. He received a 65-game suspension that prematurely ended his 2013 campaign. Yet, during his first home at-bat during the 2014 season, he was greeted with a standing ovation.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">During an introductory news conference at Marlins Park, Barry Bonds told reporters, “God knows I’m a Hall of Famer.” He then went on to say, “I know that I’m a Hall of Fame player. I don’t really need to get into that. I’ll leave that to you guys to make that determination. That’s not my fraternity. But in my fraternity, in Major League Baseball, there’s not one player that ever could sit there and say that I’m not one. There’s not a coach who ever coached me that says I’m not one.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Guess what, Barry? You’re NOT a Hall of Fame player – you ARE a cheater. And it’s a disgrace that players like you and Braun get accepted back into baseball with open arms. If you played in nitty-gritty, no nonsense era of baseball, you wouldn’t just get plunked – you’d get kicked out of the dugout. It’s a part of baseball -- just like having your teammates’ back is a part of baseball. That part of baseball is known as the “Unwritten Rules of Baseball.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Baseball has always had its unwritten rules. If you dishonor the game, a team, or a player in any way, you’re getting plunked in the back. However, those rules are regulated more and more by umpires nowadays. Umpires issue warnings after questionable pitches to protect the teams. If a pitcher still goes after a batter after a warning is issued, he gets tossed along with the manager, and faces a suspension. Because of that, hitters are not afraid to get beaned anymore. Before, if a player hit a homer and admired it, the next batter could expect to get a fastball in his back.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Now imagine if a pitcher strikes out a hitter and does a cartwheel off the mound. This was the case last year when Rays ace Chris Archer struck out Red Sox slugger David Ortiz to escape a jam. Archer jumped off the mound, yelled, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pzznLZrHvc" target="_blank">pumped his fist while hopping back</a> to the dugout. Later he told reporters, “Showing emotion is part of having fun and playing a game.” However, the year before, Ortiz crushed a 3-run homer, flipped his bat, and slowly trotted around the bases. This prompted Archer to say, “He feels like he’s bigger than the game.” Isn’t flipping your bat after hitting a homer a hitter’s way of “showing emotion and having fun”?</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">I grew up watching Tom Glavine, John Smoltz, Greg Maddux, Chipper Jones, Andruw Jones, Bobby Cox, and that generation of the Braves. Bobby Cox was a no-nonsense manager. I remember watching an 18-year-old Andruw Jones launch two homers in his first two at-bats in the 1996 World Series against the Yankees. He ran the bases without much brouhaha. Glavine, Smoltz, and Maddux, despite their dominance each time out, never showed a hitter up. Yes, they would proceed to hug the catcher after a win (as is customary), but never did they show a hitter up. Chipper Jones never sat around to admire any of his homers.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Bobby Cox would never put up with any of it. Players like Brian McCann and Jason Heyward can attest to that. Everyone knows about the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6OxpsF4aNw" target="_blank">McCann and José Fernández</a> incident or the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAxJunWPDdg" target="_blank">McCann and Carlos Gomez</a> incident. Heyward launched a monster 3-run shot with his first swing in the big leagues, and he sprinted home. To this day, he sprints around the bases. That’s just how the Braves players display themselves.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Yankees players can attest to that, too. Derek Jeter never showed anyone up during his career. Mariano Rivera, the greatest closer in the history of baseball, never showed any hitters up. Both had every right to gallivant around baseball fields flashing their World Series rings and pumping every first, but neither did either of those things. Instead, they showed up like consummate professionals and quietly collected one title after another.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">I’m a fan of the old, unwritten rules of baseball. If you dishonor the game, a team, or a player, in any way, you <em>should</em> get hit. It’s that simple: play the game the right way. But truth is, we’re losing that generation of baseball and professionalism. That just isn’t our version of baseball anymore. Fans see Stephen Curry shimmying after hitting 3s. They see Cam Newton dabbing after every touchdown. They see players everywhere celebrating, except for baseball players. Baseball needs flair, right?</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Last week, Bryce Harper told <a href="http://espn.go.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/14935765/washington-nationals-bryce-harper-wants-change-baseball-forever" target="_blank">ESPN The Magazine</a> that baseball is “a tired sport, because you can’t express yourself. You can’t do what people in other sports do. I’m not saying baseball is, you know, boring or anything like that, but it’s the excitement of the young guys who are coming into the game now who have flair.” And he has no problem with a pitcher showing emotion on the mound.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Former MVP Mike Trout voiced the opposite opinion, “I just keep it the same. I don’t try to show anybody up. Whatever somebody else does, that’s what they do.” He also said that flipping the bat qualifies as an instance of showing up the pitcher, no matter how big the moment at hand.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Trout’s Angels teammate C. J. Wilson says, “Look, dudes just want to get on TV. So, they pimp it at the plate. It’s like the NBA. They don’t want just to dunk on you. They want [people] to say, ‘He jumped all the way over that guy!’ They want to see it on replay the next day. This started with Barry Bonds, because he was better than anyone at hitting homers. He’d stand and fold his arms after a long home run. But I’ve seen guys pimp it when they are 17 years old. They’re still doing it.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">“I’m not a big fan of the bat flip,” says Orioles slugger Chris Davis. “It shows up the pitcher. Sometimes, you have to act like you’ve been there before. The only time you should bat-flip is on a walk-off.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">“If Manny Ramirez hits a home run and does his thing at the plate on the bases, well, he’s Manny Ramirez. He can do that,” says Dodgers pitcher Brandon McCarthy. “But when Ronnie Belliard, who swings just like Manny and does the same thing as Manny after he hits a home run, does it, it’s not the same because he’s not Manny. I was angry for a week over that one. David Ortiz does the same bat flip after every home run. He carries a Mariachi band around the bases with him every time he hits one. But it’s O.K. because he’s Big Papi. To me, it’s just so arbitrary.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Veteran infielder Greg Dobbs says, “When you pimp a home run, or flip a bat egregiously...I’m not saying you have to put your personality in the shadows, but how far do you take it? When you do that, act selfishly, you are disrespecting the founders of the game, the guys that came before you. When you hit a homer, flip your bat, walk 10 feet toward first base and stare at the pitcher, showing bravado, you are disrespecting the other team, your team and the name on the front of jersey. That’s the worst thing you can do.”</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Clearly, I’m not a fan of pimping a home run or showing up a batter. But if you’ve just hit one of the most important homers in franchise history, like José Bautista did last year versus the Rangers in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UdsVO7HaJg" target="_blank">Game 5 of the ALDS</a>, I wouldn’t mind you flipping your bat.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Or if you’ve just turned a huge double play in the bottom of the 9th inning while the bases were loaded with only one out during a playoff game that you desperately needed to win, like Derek Lee did, I wouldn’t mind you fist pumping.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">And if you capped that game with a homer that landed in McCovey’s Cove, <a href="http://m.mlb.com/video/v12783913/atlsf-gm-2-ankiel-belts-a-goahead-jack-in-the-11th/?game_pk=286329" target="_blank">like Rick Ankiel did</a>, I wouldn’t mind you running the bases while pointing to the sky.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">And if you gave your team the lead like Eric Hinske did in <a href="http://m.mlb.com/video/v12801561/sfatl-gm-3-hinske-jacks-a-goahead-homer-to-right/?mlbtax=nlds_2010" target="_blank">Game 3 of the 2010 NLDS</a>? Well, that’s fine by me.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">However, there’s a time and a place to celebrate these achievements. Don’t show anyone up. Respect the players and respect the game. If you hit a clutch homer or get a big out when you’re in a jam, you can celebrate. But there’s no reason to show up pitchers every time you go deep, or show up hitters whenever you strike them out. Flair isn’t everything in the game of baseball – show some professionalism and don’t aid the media in making a joke out of you.</p></div>
