				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Clayton Kershaw, the proud owner of three NL Cy Young Awards and one NL MVP Award before turning 28, just might be the best pitcher of all time. After posting a 16-7 record with a 2.13 ERA and 301 strikeouts last season, Kershaw is still taking a leap forward this season…if that’s possible.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Since breaking into the big leagues at the young age of 20 in 2008, Kershaw has gotten better every single year. After posting a 4.26 ERA in his rookie campaign, he has had seven straight seasons in which he has posted an ERA below 3.00. In recent memory, only Pedro Martínez and Greg Maddux have been able to accomplish that feat. Let’s take a look at how Kershaw’s numbers compare to theirs over this stretch:</p></div>
				
				<img src="may-mlb-article-images/greg-maddux.png" class="each_epl_image">
				
				<img src="may-mlb-article-images/pedro-martinez.png" class="each_epl_image">
				
				<img src="may-mlb-article-images/clayton-kershaw.png" class="each_epl_image">
								
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">While Maddux and Martínez pitched during the Steroid Era, Kershaw has combined power with precision to a whole new level. Kershaw is the only one of these three pitchers that has a no-hitter to his name. However, Kershaw was magnificent that night, and only lost the perfect game due to a Hanley Ramírez error. In Martínez’s defense, he would have had a perfect game but he lost it in the tenth inning of a game against San Diego back in 1995. And for Greg Maddux, he always said that he could <a href="http://old.chronicle.augusta.com/stories/1998/06/28/oth_232057.shtml" target="_blank">never throw a no-hitter</a> because he always pitched to contact.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">On Tuesday night, Kershaw struck out 11 batters while walking none. That extended his own modern-day record of striking out 10 or more while walking one or none to six consecutive starts. That puts his K/BB ratio to 22.00 (88 Ks to 4 BBs). But here is a scary thought: Can Clayton Kershaw become even more imposing and dominant? The answer is a resounding “YES,” and here are the numbers to back it up.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>22.00 K:BB Ratio</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Let me reiterate what I said before: Kershaw has walked four batters ALL YEAR. Four batters! Right now, Phil Hughes holds the record with an 11.6 mark, but Kershaw is on pace to nearly double that record. We know that he’s always been a pitcher with great command, but his present-day command might be even greater than Maddux’s in his prime.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>1.37 FIP</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">There has been no pitcher since 1908 who has had a FIP (<a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/library/pitching/fip/" target="_blank">fielding independent pitching</a>) as low as 1.37. The pitcher that last had a FIP lower than that was Christy Mathewson, who is a Hall of Famer. His FIP proves how dominant Kershaw truly is and sheds light on his preternatural ability to control his true outcomes: strikeouts, walks, and home runs.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>.458 OPS</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The .458 OPS is not opponents’ OPS against Kershaw, but his own OPS. Hitters have a combined .452 OPS against Kershaw. So that means Kershaw is outhitting the hitters he is facing. That’s pretty absurd.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>.700 WHIP</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">I’ve talked about the four walks, but Kershaw has been able to limit base runners on the whole this year. His .700 WHIP would be the lowest ever – narrowly beating out Pedro Martinez’s .737 WHIP during the 2000 season – recorded by a pitcher in baseball history.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>.070</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Hitters are hitting and slugging just .070 off of Kershaw’s curveball. Kershaw’s ability to get on top of the curve and generate late breaking movement is the biggest reason why he has so much success with this pitch. On average, it sits around 73 MPH and breaks -9.3 inches along the y-axis and -0.9 inches along the x-axis. Those curve balls are harder to read than Dostoyevsky!</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Late-game performances</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Kershaw has pitched into the seventh inning or later in all nine of his starts. He has an ERA of 0.00 after the seventh inning. To sum it up, if Kershaw has the lead going into the seventh inning, there’s a great chance he will win.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“You watch tape, or you watch him on TV, and you come up with a game plan,” said Arizona’s left fielder Mark Trumbo. “But then when you get in the box it’s totally different. You’ve gotta trust what your eyes see. But when he’s on the mound nothing adds up. You think the ball’s going to be in one area and it ends up being somewhere else and then you’re just not quick enough to get to it.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Mark Trumbo, as quoted by Molly Knight in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Best-Team-Money-Can-Buy/dp/1494566192" target="_blank">“The Best Team Money Can Buy”</a></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>An average game score of 74.2</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">For people who don’t know what average game score is, it is another way to evaluate a pitcher’s effectiveness and it follows these simple steps:</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>•</b> Start with 50 points</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>•</b> Add one point for each out recorded</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>•</b> Add two points for each inning completed after the fourth inning</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>•</b> Add one point for each strikeout</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>•</b> Subtract two points for each hit allowed</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>•</b> Subtract four points for each earned run allowed</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>•</b> Subtract two points for each unearned run allowed</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>•</b> Subtract one point for each walk </p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">His 74.2 average game score is four points higher than the next best – Jake Arrieta. From 2008 to 2014, Kershaw had an average game score of 60.8 and has led all pitchers in this category since 2011. This number spiked up to 70.3 in 2014 before dropping down to 68.0 a year ago. His 74.2 only goes to show us how improved Kershaw has been this year than he has been in years past.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>An 8-1 record</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The Dodgers are 8-1 when Kershaw takes the mound and they are just 13-21 when anyone else starts. This has been the case over the past few years, which truly proves that Kershaw can put this franchise on his back and carry them.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">Starters are given 100 to 110 or so pitches before they’re removed from games. If they try to strike everyone out, they can burn through their bullets by the fifth inning, and leave the next four innings up to the bullpen. Kershaw learned that if he wanted to stick around deep into games to have more of a say in the outcome, he’d have to learn how to get as many cheap, one- or two-pitch outs as he could. In his first season he went seven innings just twice. In 2012 [four years later] he did it twenty-two times.</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Molly Knight, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Best-Team-Money-Can-Buy/dp/1494566192" target="_blank">“The Best Team Money Can Buy”</a></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Built for superstardom</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">As great as Kershaw has been this season, he thinks he can be better. After his first start of the season against the Padres, Buster Olney of ESPN asked Kershaw about his performance and his devastating slider. Kershaw told Olney that he was not happy with his slider and that it was “too flat.” Kershaw had fired seven innings of one-hit, shutout baseball while striking out nine that day, but he still wasn’t happy at all with the way he pitched.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">After throwing a complete-game shutout against the Mets on May 12th, Kershaw called his stuff “average.” He had surrendered only three hits, walked one, and struck out 13 in that outing, yet in the mind of Clayton Kershaw, it was the pitching edition of a stink bomb. I think any other pitcher with that line would say their stuff was better than average. But Kershaw continues to assert that he can be better, particularly with his slider.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">So far this season, Kershaw has thrown the slider 300 times, and batters are hitting .114 against it. It averages 5.7 inches of movement, which is a vast improvement over the 4.6 inches it had averaged last year. However, in 2012 it averaged 6.0 inches of movement, which is where Kershaw is trying to get back to. And while his fastball isn’t blowing radar guns away – it averages 93 MPH – he has the best control I’ve seen since Greg Maddux, and has the ability to reach back and throw 95-97 MPH whenever he wants to. But even with his bulls-eye precision, he feels he can locate the fastball better. It’s pretty crazy to imagine what the numbers would look like if Kershaw pitches the way he knows he can.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Clayton Kershaw is no ordinary pitcher. He is someone that is destined for the Hall of Fame. And while many may argue that Jake Arrieta is better right now, I disagree. Arrieta is dominant in his own way, but what Kershaw is doing is just ludicrous. He’s posting numbers that we have never seen before, and is on pace to finish the season with more wins than walks. I’ve watched Maddux, Pedro, and many others pitch in their primes. Whenever I watched them I always thought to myself, one day I’m going to tell my kids that I saw some of the best pitchers in the game pitch.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">These days, I get the chance to watch Clayton Kershaw pitch while he’s having the most dominant stretch of seasons that any pitcher has ever had. I know I will be telling the next generation that I saw The Great One pitch.</p></div>
