				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Has anyone had a more polarizing Opening Week than Zack Greinke? <em>Bleacher Report</em>’s <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2631707-how-worried-should-diamondbacks-be-about-2065-million-man-zack-greinke" target="_blank">Zachary D. Rymer</a> is already leading “the sky is falling” brigade after the 32-year-old Greinke began his Diamondbacks reign with a 0-2 record. According to Rymer, instead of the Staples “EASY” button, the Dbacks executives are busy hunting down the “PANIC” one, which shouldn’t be hard to locate for a club that once pinned its hopes on a certain Russ Ortiz, who signed a four-year, $33 million deal with the club back in 2005 and proceeded to start a total of 28 games en route to amassing a raging tire fire of an ERA (6.89 in 2005 and 7.54 in 2006) and a negative WAR (-2.4). Ortiz was finally released in June 2006, with the Dbacks still owing him a gaudy $22 million.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Clearly, Zack Greinke, who had a career season last year with the Dodgers (32 starts, 222.2 innings, 1.66 ERA, and 200 K’s), is not about to pull a Russ Ortiz here. In fact, when we reflect on this season in October, we’ll see that Greinke’s 2016 season moved out from the Russ Ortiz dumpster and into the Russ Westbrook and Russ Wilson mansion.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">According to FanGraphs, an astounding <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statsd.aspx?playerid=1943&position=P&type=3&gds=&gde=&season=2016" target="_blank">47.4% of the Rockies’ batted balls</a> off of Greinke were recorded as hard hits. In his second start of the season against the dominant Cubs lineup, Greinke improved his command and, as a result, the hard hits percentage plummeted down to 38.9%. He also began to serve up more fastballs and changeups against the Cubs while lessening the curve balls and sliders. All of these changes led to Greinke breezing eight strikeouts past the Cubbies (he only had two against the Rockies). Last season, the Cubs <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/stats/team/_/stat/batting/year/2015/sort/strikeouts/type/expanded/order/true" target="_blank">led the majors in strikeouts</a>, so Greinke’s eight K’s may have been helped along by an aggressive Cubs lineup (the Cubs are 11th this season in K’s).</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">While Greinke doesn’t have the <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/stats/team/_/stat/fielding/year/2015/order/false" target="_blank">lethal Dodgers defense</a> behind him any more, Arizona’s platoon is more than capable. Offensively, the Dbacks were <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/stats/team/_/stat/batting/year/2015/sort/OPS/order/true" target="_blank">top ten</a> in almost every notable category last season. This season, A.J. Pollock’s elbow injury will hurt the fiery Diamondback offense, but stars like Jean Segura, David Peralta, and Paul Goldschmidt, who is a superstar in his own right, should keep the unit humming along.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Unfortunately, despite the dominant offense and defense supporting him in his every start, Greinke did trade in the pitcher-friendly Dodger Stadium for the hitter’s paradise in Chase Field by signing with the Dbacks. Last season at home, he was absolutely locked in, with the Dodgers defense and large outfield helping out when needed, as he eased to a 1.46 ERA, 10 wins, and 117.1 innings pitched in his Dodger Stadium starts.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The change in home stadiums may prove to be too arduous to overcome for a Zack Greinke who will soon have baseball’s version of Father Time hovering around him. However, even if years five and six of Greinke’s six-year Dbacks contract may not result in impressive contributions, his first four years, including this one, should return a net positive in the end (barring injuries, of course). And that’s all you can ask out of your $206.5 million pitcher.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Seven Significant Signs and Signals</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In most of his weekly NBA columns, Zach Lowe of ESPN has a section in the second half titled “10 Things I Like and Don’t Like.” The section, on most occasions, features interesting nuggets that Lowe picks up from week-to-week of watching numerous NBA games. In a similar vein – and in honor of Zach’s trailblazing NBA writing – I plan to continue and extend his efforts to the MLB.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">What’s with the title? Well, first off, everyone loves alliteration. Second of all, I always find it amusing when the T.V. cameras pick up a third base coach or a manager delivering the intricate hand-to-nose-to-ear-to-whatever-else routine, letting a hitter or base runner know the grand plan heading into the upcoming pitch.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Just like that routine, these seven “signs and signals” of mine will be things that don’t completely make sense to me, but are either hilarious (at times) or integral in illustrating the hidden beauty of baseball. Don’t take them too seriously, either. It’s all in good fun.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">So, let’s get started, shall we?</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>1. The Royals glittering in gold</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Much to the chagrin of the New York Mets, the title-happy Kansas City Royals took the field on Opening Day (and also in their second game a few days later) decked out in their traditional home uniforms, looking to celebrate the title in proper fashion. The unis did come with a slight (gold) tweak, however.</p></div>
				
				<img src="apr-mlb-article-images/royals-gold-unis.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Royals/photos/pb.35686273690.-2207520000.1460415588./10153620044983691/" target="_blank">KANSAS CITY ROYALS FACEBOOK PAGE</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Instead of the all-royal-blue, cursive “Royals” emblazoned across their chests, the organization opted to go with a gold-and-royal-blue combination that re-proclaimed their World Champions status, in case there was anyone doubting the achievement. Personally, I loved the visual touch, and it’s a small way to celebrate a hard-fought, but well-deserved championship.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Want to know who started this “glitter-in-gold” tradition, for better or worse? The 2005 <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/15154546/uni-watch-friday-flashback-mlb-opening-day-glitters-gold" target="_blank">Boston Red Sox</a>, who rang in their first championship in 86 long years with some gold uniform touch that would’ve left even King Midas jealous.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>2. The Diamondbacks covered in snake skin?</b></p></div>		
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Speaking of small, beautiful uniform tweaks, the Diamondbacks were one of the teams that completely flipped the bird to that idea and underwent a uniform-based midlife crisis. Sure, the color combinations remain the same (and great) as ever, but that fading “snake skin” pattern doesn’t help matters. Whereas the Royals’ use of gold subtly, but faithfully proclaimed a powerful message (“We’re World Champions, baby!”), the Dbacks’ fading snake skin proclaims, “We may or may not have hired the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/13105683/dissecting-los-angeles-clippers-new-uniforms" target="_blank">LA Clippers’</a> uniform designer. And we may or may not be regretting that move.”</p></div>

				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a href="https://www.facebook.com/D-backs/photos/pb.103089705004.-2207520000.1460415884./10156658568720005/" target="_blank">ARIZONA DIAMONDBACKS FACEBOOK PAGE</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Of course, the great news is that Arizona will be deploying these bad boys with a cadre of <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/eye-on-baseball/25400220/look-diamondbacks-unveil-seven-new-uniforms-for-2016" target="_blank">other, better unis</a>, so we’ll be spared the injustice of having to look at these often. And who knows? Over the course of a 162-game season, these may grow on me.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>3. How are the top free agency starting pitchers from last year doing so far?</b></p></div>		
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In the offseason, the MLB free agency period saw teams splurge boatloads of money on starting pitchers. This is how the five highest-paid pitchers signed in free agency did in their first few outings of this young season.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">A. Zack Greinke, Arizona Diamondbacks, 6-years, $206.5 million: 2 starts (vs. COL, vs. CHC), 10.0 IP, 9.90 ERA, 10 K’s, 16 hits allowed, 0-2 record</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">B. David Price, Boston Red Sox, 7-years, $217 million: 1 start (at CLE), 6.0 IP, 3.00 ERA, 10 K’s, 5 hits allowed, 1-0 record</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">C. Johnny Cueto, San Francisco Giants, 6-years, $130 million: 2 starts (at MIL, vs. LAD), 14.0 IP, 4.50 ERA, 12 K’s, 16 hits allowed, 2-0 record</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">D. Jordan Zimmerman, Detroit Tigers, 5-years, $110 million: 1 start (vs. NYY), 7.0 IP, 0.00 ERA, 3 K’s, 2 hits allowed, 1-0 record</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">E. Jeff Samardzija, San Francisco Giants, 5-years, $90 million: 1 start (at MIL), 5.1 IP, 5.06 ERA, 6 K’s, 8 hits allowed, 0-0 record</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Aside from Greinke and Samardzija, not bad for a fantastic five that will make upwards of a combined $750+ million over the lifetime of their respective contracts.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>4. Mad Bum agitates Kershaw</b></p></div>		
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The Bay Area has to be one of the best sports towns to reside in right now. They have the ability to not only watch “Chef Curry with the shot” do his thing at Oracle, but now they get “Mad Bum with the bat” hitting homers off of Clayton Kershaw, who allowed only 35 home runs in total from 2013 to 2015. What’s more impressive is that, as <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/the-history-of-madison-bumgarner-vs-clayton-kershaw/" target="_blank">August Fagerstorm</a> of FanGraphs points out, “A little less than 12 months ago, Bumgarner homered off Kershaw, becoming the first and still only pitcher to do so.” Keep the hits – and the timely homers – coming, Mad Bum!</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>5. Your 30 seconds are up</b></p></div>		
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">As much as Kershaw was bummed by Bumgarner’s homer in the non-hitter-friendly AT&T Park, I’m certain that pitching coaches and managers are about to unleash fury like none other on home plate umpires and MLB for regulating the amount of time they can dilly-dally at the mound. In the past, pitching coaches would come out of the dugout to sagely offer words of advice for a troubled starter or an overwhelmed reliever, and it was left to the interpretation of the umpire as to exactly how much time was dedicated to this short stoppage in play.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Nowadays, thanks to reforms from the MLB commissioner’s office, the league is attempting to speed up the pace of the game as much as possible. Sure, baseball has been and always will be America’s pastime, but it is nice to see pitching coaches jogging at supersonic speed to the mound in order to maximize the 30 seconds they have at their disposal.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>6. What a wonky Opening Week</b></p></div>		
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In addition to the surprising results of this year’s Opening Week (the Padres not putting up a run till game four of the season, the Cards getting swept in Pittsburgh), it wasn’t until I read <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/15158293/happy-new-year-baseball-2016" target="_blank">Jayson Stark’s fabulous ESPN column</a> outlining just how weird and unpredictable-yet-totally-predictable the first week has been, that I realized how interesting the games had been. This is baseball at its most enjoyable. Let the unpredictability continue, I say!</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>7. Keep on sliding (safely)!</b></p></div>		
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The infamous slide rule has quickly become the most controversial rule change this season. Thanks to my guy Chase Utley’s cringe-worthy (and ultimately unnecessary) slide into Ruben Tejada of the Mets in last year’s NLDS, Major League Baseball instituted a new rule this season that forces base runners to never leave the direct path to a base. Unfortunately, old habits die hard, and Mr. Utley himself was one of the first infringers of this new rule when he slid into home plate a foot or more off of the base path in the Dodgers’ Opening Day game in San Diego.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">From that point on, <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/mlb-big-league-stew/astros-not-happy-after-new-sliding-rules-end-rally-in-milwaukee-061618534.html" target="_blank">Toronto’s Jose Bautista and Houston’s Colby Rasmus</a> have both caught the headlines for violating the rule during pivotal, game-changing plays. I have a feeling we’re only seeing the start of many more controversial rulings when it comes to properly interpreting the slide rule. Hopefully, players will learn to operate within the rule, and the replay system should help to ensure that the correct calls are made in these dubious situations, which will arrive with increasing complexity as folks test out the finer limits of the rule.</p></div>
