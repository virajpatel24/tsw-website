				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">As soon as Wade Davis’s 95-MPH fastball fizzed past Wilmer Flores, Eric Hosmer knew he and his Kansas City Royals would transform into “World Series Champions.” As second baseman Ben Zobrist gave a point to the sky in sheer ecstasy, as Davis and his catcher embraced, as the Royals dugout stampeded Citi Field, the New York Mets dugout watched sullenly, knowing full well that they had come within a yard of greatness. The Royals knew that feeling of heartbreak and disappointment all too well having already been on the receiving end of one of the Giants’ even-year triumphs in 2014.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">For the second year in a row, Salvador Pérez displayed his preternatural abilities on baseball’s biggest stage as the Royals blitzkrieged through their postseason opposition with the small-ball manifesto in hand. While the end result proved the club’s promise, the 2015 World Series wasn’t a productive experience for first baseman Eric Hosmer, who went 4-for-21 with six RBI and seven K’s. The Mets’ fireballers gave him fits and starts throughout all five games, and Hosmer struggled to adjust.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">On the defensive end, Game 1 featured Hosmer’s edition of the <a href="https://youtu.be/18caPNisP2U" target="_blank">Bill Buckner moment</a> when Wilmer Flores hit a grounder that bounced past Hosmer’s outstretched glove, leading to a tiebreaking run late in the game. Had Alex Gordon not homered off of shutdown closer Jeurys Familia in the ninth inning, Hosmer would’ve surely cost the Royals the game.</p></div>
				
				<a href="https://twitter.com/goldbergkc/status/659248682814955520" target="_blank"><img src="may-mlb-article-images/joel-goldberg-tweet.png" class="each_epl_image"></a>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Though Hosmer’s impact in the 2015 World Series seems subpar, his potential within that Royals lineup has never been in question. In 2010, as Hosmer was working his way through the minor leagues, <a href="http://www.baseballamerica.com/majors/baseballist-dozen-stars-dominated-best-tools-prospects/#9QlJL5tbWS7L1WSI.97" target="_blank"><em>Baseball America</em></a> believed he was the best batting prospect, best power prospect, best defensive first baseman, most exciting player, and possessed the best strike-zone judgment. When he was finally promoted to The Show on May 5, 2011, journalists believed him to be the most-hyped Royals prospect since Bo Jackson.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Hosmer’s manager <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=6495925" target="_blank">Ned Yost</a> had said at the time, “There’s no question in my mind he won’t end up being a special player because he’s got all the attributes to being a special player.” The Hosmer family had sacrificed in every way to help their 21-year-old chase a dream that for many never becomes a reality. Mike Hosmer, Eric’s father, would leave tiring 48-hour shifts as a firefighter only to dutifully lob pitch after pitch to his son. His mother, Ileana, fretted over Hosmer as he straddled a life filled with homework, school, and baseball.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">All of those moments paid off as Hosmer ringed in a stellar rookie campaign in 2011 with a slash line of .293/.334/.465 while adding 19 homers, 153 hits, and 78 RBI in 523 at-bats. A year later, Hosmer hit the Sophomore Slump and muddled his way through a disappointing .232/.304/.359 line.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“You could blame a lot of that on a (mostly luck-induced) 59-point drop in his batting average on balls in play, but that was still cold comfort for Royals fans hoping for big results. It looked like more than just bad luck once Hosmer started his 2013 season with similarly ugly results — one homer through the first two months.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Jonah Keri, <a href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/mlb-2015-eric-hosmer-kansas-city-royals-potential/" target="_blank"><em>Grantland</em></a></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In 2013, his third year in the big leagues, after a slow start in the first two months of the season, Hosmer went on a rampage, ending the season with 17 homers, 188 hits (a career best to this day), 16 stolen bases, and 79 RBI. His sterling .302/.353/.448 line all but shouted the arrival of his prodigious talent to the majors. Yet just as his career started to blossom, Hosmer suffered some niggling injuries in 2014 that curtailed his fourth season to only 131 games. This trend of “one hot year, followed by one cold year” was beginning to worry journalists and executives.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">As his right hand injury recovered, Hosmer worked with Dale Sveum, the club’s hitting coach, to fix his errant swing late into the 2014 season. Whenever the Royals played defense, Hosmer would take Sveum into the club’s video room and analyze his swing frame-by-frame, according to Andy McCullough of <em>The Kansas City Star</em>.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“Sveum queued up video of Hosmer, and contrasted his swing with the swings taken by American League Central sluggers like Jose Abreu, Miguel Cabrera and Victor Martinez. The trio all presented a uniform picture, ready to strike the baseball as it arrived. Hosmer was often late, his approach disrupted by the moving parts in his mechanics.</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">The images stuck with him. When he returned from the disabled list on Sept. 1, Hosmer concentrated on shortening his stroke. The results followed.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Andy McCullough, <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/sports/mlb/kansas-city-royals/article2637110.html" target="_blank"><em>The Kansas City Star</em></a></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Soon enough, Hosmer made his return and closed out the season on a high as the Royals breathed air into their World Series hopes for the first time. But the doubts amongst the league’s executives still lingered. One executive even said, “I’m most disappointed in Hosmer, that he hasn’t been that 30-home run, 100-RBI guy with a Gold Glove. Will he be? I don’t know. Time is flying by. Probably doubtful.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But Hosmer’s teammates remained optimistic. Billy Butler, the team’s DH at the time, asserted, “He’s still young. He’s still figuring it out. I think you’re seeing a small sample of what he’s capable of. It’s something that he can do for a lot of years.” Veteran lefty Raul Ibañez added, “I think he is a superstar in the making. The ball he hit the other day, at night, at Kauffman Stadium, a missile, on a line, a no-doubter, off a left-handed pitcher — that’s the stuff that special players do.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">2015 proved to be a net positive for Hosmer as he reintroduced himself to his prodigal talents en route to hitting 18 homers, 178 hits, and 93 RBI, while producing a healthy slash line of .297/.363/.459. The injury concerns, which had persisted through portions of Hosmer’s first four seasons, also subsided as he went on to appear in 158 games. 2015 also marked Hosmer’s third straight AL Gold Glove award, a feat matched by only five other American League first basemen: Vic Power, George Scott, Eddie Murray, Don Mattingly, and Rafael Palmeiro.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Oh, and as you’ll recall from earlier, 2015 ended in a World Series ring for Eric Hosmer and the Royals. Not a bad “comeback” year from KC’s number 35.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This season, Hosmer has been on a tear – he’s already hit for four home runs and 34 hits, and is busy posting a scintillating .333/.382/.520 slash line in the process. In these 27 games, Hosmer is producing career highs in key hitting statistics, like ISO (.186), wOBA (.390), and park-adjusted offense (156). His 34 hits and .333 batting average do stem for an inordinately high .370 BABIP, which means some regression is to be expected as the sample size (games played) increases.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The hits are also coming in fast and furious thanks to Hosmer’s <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&stats=bat&lg=all&qual=y&type=2&season=2016&month=0&season1=2016&ind=0&team=0&rost=0&age=0&filter=&players=0&sort=6,d" target="_blank">61.4% ground ball rate</a>, which ranks as MLB’s fourth-highest. Hosmer’s batted balls take flight 24.1% of the time, and 20% of those fly balls have converted into home runs so far. To place this in context, Hosmer’s average exit velocity on batted balls is <a href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/statcast_leaderboard" target="_blank">93.4 MPH</a>, a figure that is neighbored by power-hitting extraordinaires like Nolan Arenado (93.1 MPH), Alex Rodriguez (93.3), Miguel Cabrera (93.8), and Michael Conforto (93.7).</p></div>
				
				<img src="may-mlb-article-images/hosmer-yost.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Royals/photos/pb.35686273690.-2207520000.1462549165./10153633649183691/" target="_blank">KANSAS CITY ROYALS FACEBOOK ACCOUNT</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Hosmer’s young career, that’s been fueled by a lethal combination of both talent and work ethic, has shown only glimpses of his supercharged abilities. Improvements to his game will have to center around that sweet, but susceptible swing and his fluctuating health. His budding legacy will also need a few more rings. But time – Hosmer turns 27 in October – and teammates are on his side, which means he’ll have plenty more chances to chase those elusive titles.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In baseball, only the strongest survive. But of that select few, the ones that experience mega-success are the individuals who make the timely adjustments and stay just ahead of the curve, never letting the league’s pitching catch them unaware. But Hosmer, who wants to be the <a href="http://m.mlb.com/cutfour/2015/12/01/157981526/video-eric-hosmer-interview" target="_blank">King of Westeros</a> when his playing career is finished, already knows that: “It’s a game of adjustments.”</p></div>
