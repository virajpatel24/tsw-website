				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Believe it or not, the San Diego area has produced some pitching virtuosos of baseball’s most recent decades, like Barry Zito, Mark Prior, Joel Zumaya, Stephen Strasburg, and Cole Hamels, to name a few examples. Yet, despite producing such elite talent, the hometown Padres haven’t been able to roster any of these aces. Zito began his career in Oakland and spent the second half of it in San Francisco. Prior only lasted five seasons in the big leagues, but spent them all in Chicago. Zumaya also spent his five-year career out of the bullpen in Detroit.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Strasburg and Hamels are the only ones who could possibly return to <a href="http://www.missionscalifornia.com/ate/why-san-diego-called-%E2%80%9C-plymouth-rock%E2%80%9D-west-coast.html" target="_blank">“The Plymouth of the West”</a> in the distant future, but the chances are slim. Strasburg just signed a mammoth <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/15496192/stephen-strasburg-washington-nationals-agree-7-year-175m-extension" target="_blank">seven-year, $175 million contract extension</a> with the Washington Nationals, proving he and the Nats are in it for the long haul. Hamels, on the other hand, has two more guaranteed years remaining on his Rangers deal, with a club option in 2019.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Contractually, neither ace is going to don the Padres colors until their mid-30’s at the earliest, but the opportunity may come sooner than we expect because both pitchers are early favorites to make the 2016 All-Star Game that’s going to be held in…you guessed it, San Diego!</p></div>
				
				<div class="video_container"><iframe class="youtube_video" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/X7E4surv9ic" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">While Hamels is a three-time All-Star and Strasburg only has one appearance to his name, both players made their last appearances in 2012. The intervening years have led to a combined two postseason appearances between the two that were largely forgettable. After 2012, Strasburg’s career subtly reached elite status as his frequent brushes with injuries lowered both expectations and attention. In the same time span, Hamels has quietly racked up one 200-inning season after another, while never losing his poise as the Phillies grappled with life in the bottom tier of The Show.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Hamels’ current team, the Texas Rangers, picked up exactly where the Phillies dropped off. Hamels helped the Phillies advance to the 2008 World Series, which they easily won 4-1 over the Tampa Bay Rays. 2009 brought another World Series appearance, but the final product remained unfinished as the Derek Jeter-led New York Yankees shuttled past them in six games. In 2010 and 2011, as the Phillies drew the last breaths from their postseason successes, the Texas Rangers propelled themselves into two straight World Series berths.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Those Rangers teams had a crop of young pitching talent – Derek Holland, Matt Harrison, and <a href="../february-2016/the-curious-career-of-cj-wilson.html">C.J. Wilson</a> – rising to the top, as the team’s offensive weapons – Michael Young, Josh Hamilton, Adrián Beltré, and Elvis Andrus – coalesced into an explosive unit. Then, both clubs slid a bit (in the Phillies’ case, they slid off of a cliff and into a dumpster). The Rangers missed the postseason in 2013 by a hair, the first time they had done so since 2009. In 2014, things only worsened as the Rangers finished with a deplorable 67-95 record, which was good enough for last place in the AL West.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Their 2015 campaign was headed in a similar direction until the tanking Phillies decided to shift into another gear on the tanking bus and traded Cole Hamels to the Rangers. At the 2015 All-Star break, the Rangers were under .500 (42-46); however, with the acquisition of Hamels, the Rangers began to work their way out of the decline. The late-season surge was enough for the Rangers to squeeze by the Astros for the divisional crown. However, in the ALDS, the Rangers were ousted in five games by the surging Blue Jays, who would meet their demise in the ALCS thanks to a Royals team hell-bent on clinching a championship.</p></div>
				
				<img src="may-mlb-article-images/al-west-standings.png" class="each_epl_image">
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This season, the Rangers are near the top of their division and Hamels is off to a blazing start: six starts, 37.0 innings pitched, 2.68 ERA, 1.22 WHIP, 36 K’s, and a 4-0 record. Only <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=4972&position=P#pitchtype" target="_blank">42.7% of his pitches</a> have been fastballs (a career low) this season, and the changeup, curve, and cutter have received equal attention. Most of the fastball usage has gone towards the nifty cutter – Hamels only deployed the cutter 14.7% of the time last year, whereas this season he’s done so 23.2% of the time.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">His clinical poise and situational awareness have been monumental in his success at Globe Life Park in Arlington, a.k.a. the American League’s <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/stats/parkfactor" target="_blank">most hitter-friendly park</a>. He’s also the posterboy for teams who value healthy starting pitchers that can give them 200+ innings each season. And his presence elevates Texas’s rotation, which has 23 quality starts – the second-most in the majors – through 34 games thus far. Not bad for a surfer dude from San Diego.</p></div>
		
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Seven Significant Signs and Signals</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">It’s been close to a month <a href="../april-2016/the-greinke-dysfunction.html">since the debut of this massively popular section</a> – just kidding, but “fake it till you make it,” right? – through which I cover the minutia of the baseball world, ranging from uniform designs to Mad Bum’s fantastic home runs that agitate Clayton Kershaw to no end. So let’s get started!</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>1. Dusty’s dilemma</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Dusty Baker, the venerated first-year manager of the Washington Nationals, is in a bit of a quandary. Baker’s opposition managers are actively strategizing about how to best quell the power-hitting extraordinaire named Bryce Harper. Joe Maddon unveiled the <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/15496133/joe-maddon-chicago-cubs-defends-bryce-harper-walks-was-strategy" target="_blank">“Let ‘em Walk”</a> plan last week as his Cubs swept the Nats over the course of four games, neutralizing and frustrating Harper in the process.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In the same series, Ryan Zimmerman received heat for not only his slow, slow start to the season – Zim’s sporting a career-low slash line of .235/.288/.383 – but also for leaving 14 men on base in the final game against the Cubbies last Sunday. Baker’s problem is that all of Washington and the media elite are calling on him to switch Zimmerman’s and Daniel Murphy’s spots in the lineup. Murphy is a free-swinging lefty who’s batting fifth and sporting a mind-boggling slash line of .398/.439/.650, and Zimmerman’s a slumping righty who’s sucking in men on base faster than a black hole.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Of course, Baker once made a career out of navigating through Barry Bonds’ most lethal seasons, and, as a result, should be trusted to figure out this “Let’s pitch around Bryce” puzzle by himself. When asked about the timeline for the Zimmerman-Murphy switch, <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/washington-nationals/post/_/id/1070/how-much-longer-before-dusty-baker-mixes-up-nationals-cleanup-spot" target="_blank">Baker coyly responded</a>, “I think you [media] guys want me to switch it up, so not yet.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>2. The Mother’s Day touch</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This year’s Mother’s Day had a special significance for Major League Baseball. Across the league, the special day arrived with uniforms that had been suffused with layers of pink. The proceeds from the pink-a-thon were donated to <a href="http://ww5.komen.org/" target="_blank">Susan G. Komen</a> and the <a href="http://www.pcf.org/site/c.leJRIROrEpH/b.5699537/k.BEF4/Home.htm" target="_blank">Prostate Cancer Foundation</a>. Baseball uniforms are always top-class, but when they are used towards funding cutting-edge research, their beauty and prestige can hang with the finest Louis or Vuitton.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">More of this next year please, MLB!</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>4. The Travis Shaw Show turns left</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">When Pablo Sandoval arrived to Spring Training nursing yet another weight control problem, the Red Sox were forced to turn to lefty Travis Shaw, who rose to the occasion and now sports a healthy .322/.383/.545 slash line after 33 games. Don’t forget: Shaw’s 39 hits, 11 doubles, four homers, and 23 RBI all reside within the top three on the team’s leaderboard.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">However, being a lefty, one would expect Shaw to have trouble against southpaws. That’s not been the case, at least thus far. In 2015, Shaw hit for a line of .329/.353/.622 with 6 home runs and 16 RBI against lefties. Against righties, Shaw declined to .243/.319/.417 with similar power numbers. While he had only connected on a lone hit in 23 plate appearances versus southpaws this season coming into last night’s game against Oakland, Shaw displayed his propensity for making lefty pitchers struggle as he went yard on Sean Manaea en route to a 3-for-5 night.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The Red Sox are the American League’s best offense by a wide margin. They lead the AL with <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/standings/_/sort/pointsfor" target="_blank">183 runs scored</a>, and only the Texas Rangers are within striking distance. If Shaw can continue to punish lefties like this, then Boston will have yet another bat to add to the murderer’s row of righty bats they already possess.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>5. Matt Cain and Jake Peavy’s performances have been lifeless</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Amongst themselves, Matt Cain and Jake Peavy have pitched 73 innings (14 starts). Those combined 73 innings have returned the following: 102 hits allowed, 61 earned runs, -1.7 WAR, 14 home runs allowed, and a sky-high ERA of 15.16. Despite those travesties, the Giants still have a 17-18 record and are only one game behind the 17-16 Dodgers.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">As the Giants’ patience grows thinner, the club will begin thinking about promoting right-handers Chris Heston and Joan Gregorio, who are both currently on the Triple-A team in Sacramento. Neither player is going to fix the back-end of the rotation with their arrival, but they will put Cain and Peavy out of their misery.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>6. Should the Angels trade Mike Trout?</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">It seemed as if everyone in the MLB universe was asking the same question as soon as the Angels announced that their ace Garrett Richards would have to undergo Tommy John surgery in the coming weeks. Thanks to Mike Trout’s Herculean efforts, the Angels haven’t been buffeted by the winds of tanking just yet. In fact, the Halos (13-19) still sit above the slumping Astros (13-21) in the AL West standings, somehow.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But we all know the Angels have the same chance of making the postseason this year as Barry Allen does of spontaneously becoming a powerful immigrant alien from Krypton. If the Halos aren’t good enough to contend, then why shouldn’t they trade Trout right now, as he nears the height of his powers?</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">You don’t trade Mike Trout because he’s Mike freaking Trout.</p></div>
				
				<img src="may-mlb-article-images/trout-jeter.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a href="https://thewayniac.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/o-mike-trout-jeter-facebook.jpg" target="_blank">WWW.WAYNIACNATION.COM</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Instead, you hold out hope that things turn your way naturally, which seems unlikely since the Angels have <a href="http://www.baseballamerica.com/majors/2015-organization-talent-rankings/#UZgIxdtdfklAfI5X.97" target="_blank">one of the worst farm systems</a> in all of baseball. Trading Trout would just give the Angels semblances of talent that, when put together, would still be unable to touch Trout’s preternatural abilities. Trading Trout for Bryce Harper – or any other qualifying superstar – straight up is no solution since the Halos would be in the same circumstance they’re in right now with Trout.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Being the consummate professional he is, Mike Trout won’t force his way out of Anaheim. So the ball is in the Angels’ court.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">My advice? If the Angels find a team wanting Mike Trout’s services, then the Halos shouldn’t pull the trigger until that team agrees to take on Albert Pujols’ monstrosity of a contract, too.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But the best advice? Stick with Mike Trout for as long as he’s willing to stay, because the Angels won’t snag another player like him for quite a while.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>7. Chase Headley and the Yankees off to a rocky start</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">It might be too early to say this, but I’ll say it anyways: The 13-18 New York Yankees are in danger of being left behind in the AL East. The division seems to be stronger than ever as the Red Sox (20-13) and Orioles (19-12) sit on top and the Blue Jays (18-17) try to hang on. The Bronx Bombers sport a below average -19 run differential through 31 games while the top three teams of the division are cranking out positive double-digit differentials.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">For the team’s third baseman, Chase Headley, things can’t be any more bleak. Headley’s days of 31 homers and 115 RBI are long gone and what remains – a slash line of .174/.265/.174 – ain’t pretty. In fact, among all qualifying hitters, Headley ranks dead last in <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/stats/batting/_/sort/slugAvg/count/157/qualified/true" target="_blank">slugging percentage</a>, at .174, by a wide margin of 35 points. All in all, not a fun place to be.</p></div>
