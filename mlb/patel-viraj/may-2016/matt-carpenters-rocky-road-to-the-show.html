				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The 2013 MLB All-Star Game was a coming-out party of sorts for late-blooming hitters. Most of these late bloomers were clustered around the age of 27 and were making their first all-star appearance: Chris Davis (age 27), Jason Kipnis (26), Alex Gordon (29), Allen Craig (28), Pedro Álvarez (26), Carlos Gómez (27), Everth Cabrera (26), and Matt Carpenter (27). That conglomeration went a collective 2-for-10, though Davis and Kipnis carried most of the load as the AL stormed its way to a 3-0 victory.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Now, approximately three years later, “Crush” Davis has sent 83 more baseballs hurtling into the stands while being put under the microscope for <a href="http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2014-09-12/sports/bs-sp-orioles-chris-davis-qa-0913-20140912_1_adderall-chris-davis-drug-policy" target="_blank">two separate instances of performance-enhancing stimulant use</a>. Kipnis, a second baseman for the Indians, has formed a thriving partnership with double-play partner Francisco Lindor, who will become a first-time all-star this year if he keeps up his excellent production (slash line of .310/.366/.408 through 43 games).</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In the happiest of feats, Alex Gordon claimed a World Series ring last year with his Kansas City Royals. In the saddest of news, Allen Craig, once a powerful menace for opposition pitchers, is now currently stuck on the Red Sox’s <a href="http://www.overthemonster.com/2016/1/13/10759208/red-sox-allen-craig-offseason-trade-rumors" target="_blank">Triple-A equivalent in Pawtucket</a>. Pedro Álvarez switched teams to the Orioles and Carlos Gómez went south from Milwaukee to Houston (but not before causing <a href="https://youtu.be/rAxJunWPDdg" target="_blank">several bench-clearing tiffs</a> in the process), however, both players remain shells of their former talented selves. And Everth Cabrera ran into a never-ending deluge of issues with law enforcement, drugs, and suspensions, which means he has now crashed out of The Show.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">That leaves us with a former 13th-round draft pick in 2009 named Matt Carpenter.</p></div>

				<img src="may-mlb-article-images/carpenter.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a href="http://sportsnaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/USATSI_7510924_168380822_lowres.jpg" target="_blank">WWW.SPORTSNAUT.COM</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Up until 2012, Matt Carpenter wasn’t even the Cardinals’ most well-known Carpenter – that honor went to former ace Chris Carpenter, who bid adieu to the game that year, at age 37, and left with a career 144-94 record and a Cy Young award to his name. But just as the older Carpenter was closing out his MLB career, the younger Carpenter broke through in 2012 with six home runs, 46 RBIs, and a slash line of .294/.365/.463 in 340 plate appearances.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But all that was only enough to garner him a sixth place vote in the 2012 NL Rookie of the Year balloting (the honor went to Bryce Harper). From 2013 to 2015, Carpenter became a chameleon of sorts for the Cardinals. In 2013, he led the majors in hits (199), runs (126), and doubles (55). Then, in 2014, he led the majors in plate appearances (709) and walks (95). Finally, in 2015, he showed his enormous raw power by mashing a career-high 28 home runs and leading the league in doubles (44). The constant mixing-and-matching didn’t just stop on the offensive end. For example, in his rookie year (2012), Carpenter was fielded at five different positions, mostly those in the corner infield and corner outfield.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">With those positions covered by Craig, David Freese, Matt Holliday, and Carlos Beltran coming into this season, Carpenter didn’t seem likely to play that much. But the Cardinals got creative. With no quality options at second base, they installed Carpenter there, hoping he would reach base enough to offset what would likely be shaky defense.</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Jonah Keri, <em>Grantland</em>, <a href="https://grantland.com/features/jonah-keri-ranks-mlb-teams-10/" target="_blank">“The 30: College of Cardinals”</a></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Throughout his professional career, Carpenter has made pitchers work in his every plate appearance. Getting on base quickly became Carpenter’s calling card, and the reason why Mike Matheny always ended up having to move Carpenter back to the leadoff position. But over the years, Carpenter has become a selective swinger, which has resulted in comparisons to other superstar second basemen, like <a href="http://www.vivaelbirdos.com/2013/11/11/5087892/robinson-cano-vs-matt-carpenter-a-comparison-of-the-second-base" target="_blank">Robinson Canó</a> and <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/fantasy/is-matt-carpenter-still-building-towards-something/" target="_blank">Dustin Pedroia</a>.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In 2013, one of his best statistical seasons to date, Carpenter led the league with 126 runs, becoming one of only 20 instances of that feat in the past ten years up to that point. Yet, he did it with significantly subpar power numbers (11 home runs). Was this run production sustainable as Carpenter hit his late twenties and early thirties?</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">In the past ten years, there have been 20 player seasons in which a player has scored 120 or more runs. Of those 20, six repeated the feat: Albert Pujols (three times), Alex Rodriguez, Carlos Beltran, Curtis Granderson, Hanley Ramirez and Jimmy Rollins. Considering that Albert Pujols did it three times with this same team, it’d be tempting to just say that Carpenter can easily repeat the feat.</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">The problem is, slugging percentage is better correlated to runs on a team level, and you might notice something about that group of hitters. They all have way more power. In fact, Matt Carpenter had the third-worst ISO among 120+ run scorers in the past ten years. If you average out the 232 players that scored more than 100 runs in that time period, their ISO is .220. It’s a lot easier to score 100-120+ runs if you plate yourself 25-30 times.</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Eno Sarris, <em>FanGraphs</em>, <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/fantasy/is-matt-carpenter-still-building-towards-something/" target="_blank">“Is Matt Carpenter Still Building Towards Something?”</a></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Now with hindsight, we can claim that the Sarris prophecy has come true. Since his 126-run campaign in 2013, Carpenter has nabbed 99 runs (in 2014) and 101 runs (2015). While he has still been in the vicinity of the vaunted 120-run mark since 2013, he’s never threatened to actually reach that mark again, despite showcasing his 28-homers and raw power last season and remaining relatively healthy throughout the past four years. This season, if he plays his usual 157 or so games, he’ll post around 101 runs at his current pace – Carpenter currently has 29 runs through 45 games.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Thankfully, while Carpenter’s run-scoring abilities provide immense value for the Cardinals lineup, he does have other means of influencing the game. Carpenter has 32 walks through 45 games right now. If he continues this pace, he’ll earn 112 of them by the end of the season, which, while impressive, will fall considerably short to <a href="http://www.masnsports.com/nationals-pastime/2016/05/bryce-harpers-unusual-slump-few-hits-tons-of-walks.html" target="_blank">Bryce Harper’s NL-leading 5,128 walks</a>.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Over the years, I’ve begun to appreciate all the unique skills and nuances Matt Carpenter brings to his every plate appearance. Whether he’s walking to the plate without batting gloves, or whether he’s taking Clayton Kershaw deep <a href="https://youtu.be/JGsfhjYLQF0" target="_blank">after an 11-pitch at-bat</a>, or whether he’s just showing us his latest league-leading skill, it’s undeniable that Carpenter is built for big league success. It took some tough times for him to get to this pinnacle, though. At his nadir, Carpenter easily gained the Freshman 15 (plus 25 more pounds) while a top recruit at Texas Christian University. Then, in his junior year, he had to undergo Tommy John surgery, which meant he had plenty of time to re-evaluate his once-promising future.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">TCU coach Jim Schlossnagle called Carpenter into his office soon after Carpenter had the surgery.</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“First he told me all the reasons why I had been the top recruit at TCU,” Carpenter said, “and that while I had been a decent player, I had not been the player they expected. He was totally right. And then he said, ‘You basically have only two choices now: you can just continue to be a decent player and get out of here and maybe become a high school or college coach, or you can get serious and let this be a wakeup call and get to work.</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“I literally changed overnight.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">Carpenter, who favored a junk-food diet of fast foods and sodas, hired a nutritionist and cleaned up his diet “cold turkey.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“I became super strict about what I ate. I went all-in,” said Carpenter, who hasn’t had a soda since and can’t remember his last fast-food burger. While he leaned out, he devoted himself to strength training and “I ran every day.” He cut about 40 pounds and came back for his redshirt season as that player TCU expected. He hit 22 home runs over his redshirt junior and senior seasons. The Cardinals drafted him in the 13th round in 2009. They offered him $1,000 to sign.</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Tom Verducci, <em>Sports Illustrated</em>, <a href="http://www.si.com/mlb/2013/06/25/matt-carpenter-cardinals" target="_blank">“Matt Carpenter's improbable path to becoming an All-Star talent”</a></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Nowadays, Carpenter took the lessons from his college reinvention and applied them to the majors. He’s led the big league – or been close to leading – in just about every major offensive statistic at least once. And every year, he brings something different, fresh, and innovative to the table. In his mid-twenties, Carpenter got his dream job: A permanent spot in the St. Louis lineup. In his mid-thirties, he’ll need to repeat what he’s become so adept and refined at doing over the years: Reinventing himself. Carpenter’s batting average has already plummeted to the .270 mark over the past two seasons, and it sits at .253 through 45 games this season. So he’ll need to find different methods to have the same devastating impact well into his thirties. The high on-base percentage will always be there, which should sustain him. But everything else, just like the junk-food diet from his TCU days, is expendable and alterable into whatever innovation Matt Carpenter cooks up next.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Seven Significant Signs and Signals</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Another week, another dollar. Well, if you’re Stephen Strasburg, then that’d be “another half-a-million dollars,” a luxury now afforded to Washington’s number 37 thanks to his massive <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/eye-on-baseball/25582436/report-nationals-agree-to-long-term-extension-with-stephen-strasburg" target="_blank">seven-year, $175 million extension</a> with the Nationals. For the rest of us common folks, we’ll just have to settle for my seven significant signs and signals.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>1. Vot is going on vith Joey Votto?</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Speaking of massive contract extensions, the Reds’ Joey Votto earned the biggest contract in Cincinnati Reds history back in 2012 when he signed a 12-year, $251.5 million extension. And just like Strasburg, Votto understood the value of staying with familiar surroundings instead of uprooting himself and his family out of Ohio just to take his once-in-a-generation talents to South Beach (not that the Marlins could’ve afford him, but, you know, just as an example).</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Since 2012, Votto has played two healthy seasons in 2013 (all 162 games) and 2015 (158 games). The intervening years were curtailed by untimely injuries. Yet, throughout that turmoil, Votto never lost his unique ability to maintain his high on-base percentage. For example, even in a 62-game 2014 season, though Votto batted only .255, he still had an on-base percentage of .390! A .390 OBP is usually a great hitter’s best year, yet for Votto that was only the low point of his reign.</p></div>
				
				<div class="video_container"><iframe class="youtube_video" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/RyUyPwfj6xI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This season has been a turbulent one for Votto. He’s finally been injury-free, however, he also sports a weak slash line of .203/.341/.351 with six homers and 24 RBIs. Given his increasing age (32) and <a href="http://www.cincinnati.com/story/sports/mlb/reds/2016/05/01/joey-votto-d-rather-quit-than-struggle/83794994/" target="_blank">recent quotes</a> (“I'd rather quit and leave all the money on the table than play at a poor level.”), it seems as if Votto’s career arc is turning more towards the Kobe Bryant route (debilitating injuries, on a bad team, and stagnating desire) when it should be on the LeBron James path (on a great team, still in the prime of his career, and still doing those <a href="https://youtu.be/wRCc3-ruNZ4" target="_blank">annoying Kia ads</a>).</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But despite all those protestations and remarks, Votto is still a grinder and one of the league’s hardest working players. Despite that hefty contract, he still hasn’t settled for being anything below his very best, and his sky-high career .420 on-base percentage (<a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/onbase_perc_career.shtml" target="_blank">the 18th-best amongst all-time qualified hitters</a>) proves that. However, at some point, the losses will continue to pile up and if Votto is still stuck in this unforeseen rut by the time the All-Star Game rolls around, we may be in for a season that rears the ugly side of Joey Votto.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>2. A Royal Regression?</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Apparently, Neil Greenberg of the Washington Post is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fancy-stats/wp/2016/05/20/the-naysayers-were-right-about-the-royals/" target="_blank">just about ready to hang up the towel</a> on the Kansas City Royals’ 2016 campaign. In a damning May 20 column, Greenberg wrote about how Kansas City’s lower team BABIP (.301 in 2015 to .292 in 2016), lower on-base percentage (“.322 in 2014 to .314 in 2015 to its current .305”), and a walk-happy starting pitching have been sapping the Royals of their potential. To be fair, this isn’t a sudden 180-degree turn on Mr. Greenberg’s initial take on Kansas City’s chances entering this season; he predicted that the Royals would go “from first [last year] to worst [this year]” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fancy-stats/wp/2016/03/29/al-central-preview-royals-projected-to-go-from-first-to-worst/" target="_blank">in a March 29 article</a>.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">How much should Royals fans be concerned about their team’s chances to hang on to their World Series crown at the end of the this season? The 23-21 Royals currently sit in third place in the AL Central, three games behind the division-leading Chicago White Sox. The club has also won the last three series that it has participated in – the Royals won two out of three against the Braves, Red Sox, and the White Sox. They still have a massive four-game showdown starting this Thursday with the White Sox in Kansas City. Then, the weekend after that, there’s yet another four-game series with the Cleveland Indians.</p></div>
					
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">All in all, I’m not worried about Ned Yost’s Royals. Of course, the starting pitching has been the club’s Achilles heel, but this early sample size of 44 games is still pretty small, all things considered. The upcoming four-game White Sox and Indians series should give Kansas City the chance to finally get back on the track. If not, then we’ll all do well to remember that the 2014 Kansas City Royals – who appeared in that year’s World Series against the Giants – were 48-50 at the All-Star break that year. Coming from behind to surprise us all is etched into the Royals’ DNA by this point.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>3. You’re the man, Clayton Kershaw! (And quite possibly the early NL MVP.)</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">When Yogi Patel <a href="../../patel-yogi/may-2016/the-great-one.html">wrote about Clayton Kershaw last Saturday</a>, Mr. Kershaw only had a 6-1 record with an ERA of 1.67, 88 strikeouts, and a WHIP of 0.70. Well, after last night’s stellar two-hit shutout against the Cincinnati Reds, Kershaw’s stats look like this: 7-1 record, 95 strikeouts, 3.3 WAR, 0.66 WHIP, .171 batting average allowed, 1.48 ERA, and five walks. FIVE walks!!! Forget the “you’re the man” stuff. This guy’s an alien placed on this Earth to fire one awesome outing after another, <a href="http://www.kershawschallenge.com/giving/" target="_blank">while saving humanity</a>, too.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>4. Don’t forget about Ichiro, either.</b></p></div>
						
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">As we indulge ourselves in Clayton Kershaw’s brilliance, let’s not forget about Ichiro, who the Marlins kept tied to their bench until now. Even at age 42, Ichiro Suzuki keeps grabbing one hit after another. In the past three games, the Marlins gave Ichiro starts in the outfield and, as usual, Ichiro brought his A-game and went 4-for-4, 2-for-4, and 4-for-5 in that span. He’s batting a sky-high .417 and looks to be tapping into the vintage Ichiro form, the same form that allowed him set the single-season hits record at 262 back in 2004.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">When he becomes eligible, Ichiro will be a certain first-ballot Hall of Famer. His accomplishments in Japan only boost his enormous contributions to the game of baseball. But most importantly, the Marlins must give him ample at-bats and help him reach the coveted 3,000-hits mark in his MLB career. He’s only 40 hits away from the landmark, and his hot bat should help him pick up a steady stream of starts, making the feat a bit more manageable.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>5. Zack Cosart’s turning out a career year in Cincy.</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The 15-30 Reds are in a massive slump and have little to no hopes of changing their fortunes in the short term. Much of the conversation during this time has revolved around Joey Votto’s struggles at the plate and the Reds’ disappointing bullpen. But the one bright spot in the lineup has been leadoff man Zack Cosart, who’s sporting a slash line of .321/.331/.533 with 5 homers and 16 RBIs. His defensive WAR of 0.7 (10th-best in the NL at the moment) at shortstop has also helped contain the mishaps of the bullpen. And more importantly, he was only one of two Reds players who managed to wrestle a hit from Clayton Kershaw’s epic outing last night.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Rumors have been circulating that the Reds are looking to shop the star around to see what comes up, however, they may do well to keep him, because at the moment, he’s the team’s only star meeting his potential.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>6. Jackie Bradley, Jr.’s unbelievable 27-game hitting streak.</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Now that we’re talking about a “star meeting his potential,” meet the new poster boy for the phrase: The Boston Red Sox’s Jackie Bradley, Jr. (a.k.a. JBJ). True Red Sox fans, like <a href="../../../contributors/matt-dengler-archives/all-works-md.html">Matt Dengler</a>, always knew of Jackie Bradley, Jr.’s sky-high potential even as early as last year. But did anybody expect a 27-game hitting streak to suddenly pop up from JBJ’s bat? Matt even went on to tell me last week, “These are the type of streaks that make me question my non-belief in hot and cold streaks.” Famous daily fantasy sports player Jonathan Bailes has always argued that hot and cold streaks don’t exist for MLB hitters, which is why Matt was taken aback by JBJ’s apparent hot streak.</p></div>
					
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">But I also believe it’s going to be really, really difficult to separate what’s “real” in terms of a hot streak from what’s just randomness. Maybe a player is hitting well because of specific factors that could help him hit better than normal in the future, but maybe it’s just variance. Hitters can be crushing the ball and just get unlucky with placement, or they could be really seeing the ball poorly and still get on base just from dumb luck, and trying to understand hot and cold streaks in a way that’s predictive is at best extremely challenging and at worst impossible.</p>

				</div>
					
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Bailes may have a point here. Jackie Bradley, Jr. seems to be getting extremely lucky. His .396 BABIP tells us that his .342 batting average is due for a regression back to the mean in the coming days. However, that doesn’t mean JBJ’s streak is in jeopardy, since a streak continues as long as JBJ can muster up a hit in every game he plays. In that sense, he’ll regress back to the mean by going 1-for-4 or 1-for-3 over the course of the streak. But until this streak ends, I’ll be thoroughly enjoying his every at-bat.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>7. Miggy’s finding his elite form. </b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Miguel Cabrera came into a series-ending game against the Baltimore Orioles on May 15 with a meager .281 batting average. After that day’s 6-5 victory, the Tigers have gone on to win six out of their past seven games, and Miguel Cabrera also reintroduced himself to his batting prowess in the process.</p></div>
					
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">Cabrera took six swings Monday -- two home runs, a double deep to right-center, and three foul balls. He did not miss once, though one foul tip was caught for a strike. He hasn't swung and missed on a pitch since his second at-bat Wednesday. He has taken 33 swings since then, either putting balls in play on [sic] fouling them off. He hasn't struck out since May 13, when Chris Tillman got him swinging in Baltimore.</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Jason Beck, <em>MLB.com</em>, <a href="http://m.mlb.com/news/article/179878176/tigers-miguel-cabrera-extends-hot-streak" target="_blank">“Miggy on prolific tear -- even by his standards”</a></p>
				</div>
					
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">It seems like all is right with the world again. Mike Trout, after a rough start to his season, has been producing a slash line of .325/.413/.568 with 10 home runs and 31 RBIs. Now Cabrera, who has a reinvigorated slash line of .327/.401/.588 with 11 homers and 28 RBI, and Trout are only waiting on fellow sluggers Bryce Harper (.252/.441/.548), Giancarlo Stanton (.213/.328/.467), Joey Votto (.203/.341/.351), Andrew McCutchen (.249/.335/.462) and Paul Goldschmidt (.245/.412/.445) to figure things out, which should only be a matter of when, not if.</p></div>
