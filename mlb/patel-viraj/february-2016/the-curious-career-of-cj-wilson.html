				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In the offseason leading up to the 2012 MLB season, the Los Angeles Angels were in a high-speed chase to sign pitcher C.J. Wilson, a 30-year-old southpaw with a career 43-35 record who had appeared in his first All-Star Game the previous season. In 2010, his first full year as a starter for the Texas Rangers, Wilson pitched 204 innings while going 15-8 and recording 170 strikeouts. The 93 walks he allowed were a bit high, but they didn’t detract from his great season.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">2011 became Wilson’s proving ground as he went 16-7 in his 34 starts, which led to his sixth-place finish in that year’s <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_2011.shtml#ALcya" target="_blank">AL Cy Young voting</a> (Justin Verlander, who went an astounding 24-5 that year, would end up with the award). But as great as 2011 was, it also marked the end of Wilson’s Rangers contract, which meant quite a few clubs would begin courting Texas’s top pitcher. Wilson’s proven success in the postseason with the Rangers in 2010 and 2011 only spiked his worth and value to prospective teams.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Wilson’s final two seasons in Arlington were by and large unparalleled. Only nine AL pitchers had thrown for more innings than Wilson’s combined 427.1 in those two years. And out of those nine, only four – CC Sabathia, Félix Hernández, Jered Weaver, and Justin Verlander – had a better ERA. But the principle concerns surrounding Wilson’s true potential all related to Wilson’s ability to continue the dominance he displayed in his final two Rangers seasons.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“Wilson is difficult to project for a couple reasons, as his years as a reliever make it a little more difficult to evaluate what will happen the next five seasons, especially his ability to stay healthy. There are two mind-sets on that: 1. His years as a reliever saved wear and tear on his arm, so he actually has less mileage on it than most 31-year-olds. 2. Because he's only started for two seasons, we don't know if his arm can hold up for 200-plus innings for six, seven seasons in a row.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— David Schoenfield, <em>ESPN</em>, <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/sweetspot/post/_/id/18807/a-look-into-c-j-wilsons-future" target="_blank">“A look into C.J. Wilson’s future…”</a></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Since teams would have to pony up close to $100 million for C.J. Wilson’s talents for the next five years, their hesitance in snapping up the lefty made sense. Additionally, it is much easier for pitchers to go into a tailspin after hitting age 30 than it is for positional players, especially since the position players can continue to contribute in any number of ways (hit for power or contact, defense, base running, and more). And an injury to the elbow or shoulder of a pitcher’s throwing arm can spell an early end to any career.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Those are all considerations that the Angels and first-year general manager Jerry Dipoto were weighing as they deliberated upon C.J. Wilson’s résumé of work. Snagging Wilson from the hands of the Rangers, their long-time AL West divisional foes, would not only remove Texas’s ace from Arlington, but it would give the Angels another solid arm to enlist in a star-studded starting five already featuring the likes of Jered Weaver, Ervin Santana, Dan Haren, and Zack Greinke.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">On December 8, 2011, the LA Angels shocked the baseball world by not only signing C.J. Wilson to a 5-year, $77.5 million contract, but they also managed to take Albert Pujols, a sure-fire first-ballot Hall of Famer, off of St. Louis’s hands for a cool $240 million (over the next ten years). By adding a top-shelf starting pitcher (Wilson) <em>and</em> the top offensive weapon (Pujols) on the 2011 free agency market, the Angels immediately put themselves into every conversation that used the phrase “World Series.”</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This Spring Training, as Wilson enters the fifth and final year of his Angels contract, the conversation has changed from “World Series” to “Why are the Angels always underachieving in the AL West?” in the intertwining years. Since the tale has gone so South, let’s revisit each year of C.J.’s Angels career and examine what took place, which could help explain the Angels’ precipitous fall from those hallowed expectations.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>2012</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">C.J. Wilson threw his first pitch in full Angels regalia in the most interesting way possible: With the help of Sports Illustrated model Kate Upton and MLB 2K12. </p></div>
				
				<div class="video_container"><iframe class="youtube_video" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/OXptvx-RSRY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Of course, after dominating gamers left-and-right on MLB 2K12, stepping onto the baseball diamond should’ve been a relatively easy transition for the southpaw, but the 2012 season ended up being the farthest from that for both Wilson and the Angels. The team struggled to perform as Albert Pujols struggled to recapture the genius of his Cardinals days. Pujols, who had been a .329 hitter in St. Louis, hit only .285 in 2012. His power numbers also declined precipitously.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">On the pitching end of things, Jered Weaver would have a Cy Young-worthy season with a 20-5 record and a 2.81 ERA. But C.J. Wilson struggled under the California Sun, posting a disappointing 13-10 record, with 202.1 innings pitched and a 3.83 ERA. Dan Haren (12-13 record, 4.33 ERA) and Ervin Santana (9-13, 5.16 ERA) struggled, too. But the rotation’s fifth man, Zach Greinke, had a superb campaign – he put up a healthy 6-2 record in his 13 Angels starts – after arriving from Milwaukee on July 27.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But for Mike Scocia and the Angels, their 89-73 record (only third-best in the AL West after the 94-68 Oakland Athletics and the 93-69 Texas Rangers) didn’t do enough to help their playoffs dreams. Heading into 2013, the Angels were determined to finally take over in their division, and the ascension of Mike Trout would, hopefully, provide just the firepower necessary.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>2013</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The 21-year-old Mike Trout burst onto the scene in 2012, but he exploded onto the scene and made it his own in 2013. He would hit for both power (27 homers, 97 RBI, and 109 runs) and contact (.323 batting average, 190 hits, and 110 walks). Albert Pujols, on the other hand, kept diving into dire straits in 2013, hitting a dreadful .258, with only 17 homers and 64 RBI in a season plagued by injuries (Pujols only played in 99 games in 2013).</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In year two of his Angels deal, C.J. Wilson finally began to figure things out. He experienced a rough start to his season, but then after the All-Star break, Wilson started firing strike after strike en route to a career-best 17-7 record, with a 3.39 ERA and 212.1 innings. His 188 strikeouts were also the second-highest of his career (and remain so to this day).</p></div>
				
				<div class="video_container"><iframe class="youtube_video" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/qxcvwPxtLxI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">After seeing the struggles he faced in his first year, watching C.J. finally figure out all of the pitches in his arsenal and make batters whiff with both his power and pinpoint accuracy made for a great viewing experience each time Wilson took the mound. But just as the southpaw was figuring things out, the Angels began having pitching issues elsewhere in the rotation. Starter Joe Blanton would finish 2-14 on the season, and Jerome Williams and the up-and-coming Garrett Richards didn’t have great campaigns, either.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The Angels (78-84) would once again finish third in the AL West in Year Two of the Wilson-Pujols Experiment.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>2014</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Finally, in 2014, the LA-based ball club figured it out. The Halos finished first in the AL West with a dominating 98-64 record, which was the best in all of baseball. Mike Trout had a season for the ages as he went on to hit .287, with 36 homers, 111 RBI, and 115 runs. The young phenom’s showing earned him his first MVP award, and cemented his place as the face of MLB. Albert Pujols had a bounce-back year as well, hitting .272, with 28 homers, 105 RBI, and 172 hits.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">On the mound, the Halos obtained 13-win seasons from C.J. (13-10) and Garrett Richards (13-4) while getting Cy Young-worthy outings from ace Jered Weaver (18-9) and Matt Shoemaker (16-4). The Halos also shipped off closer Ernesto Frieri to the Pirates and traded for Huston Street mid-season, a veteran closer with stellar skills who was much more reliable at closing a game out than the streaky Frieri.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">After the Kansas City Royals defeated the Oakland Athletics with a 1-0 scoreline in the AL Wild Card showdown, the Boys in Blue carried that swagger to Angels Stadium and walked away with a 3-0 series victory, effectively drubbing the Halos on their way to a World Series appearance. C.J. started Game 3 in that series and the pressure to turn the Angels’ playoffs collapse was all on his shoulders. After a 3-run first inning, the Royals were never going to give up a 2-0 series lead at Kaufmann Stadium.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The 2014 season was easily one of the Angels’ best seasons in quite some time, however, C.J. Wilson simply couldn’t tap into that untouchable pitching he displayed in some of his Rangers postseason heroics. In three years, the Angels had zero playoff wins, and one of the league’s largest payrolls…not a great place to be.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>2015</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">After the epic dismantling in the 2014 postseason, the Halos were committed to shore up on their weaknesses heading into 2015. Hank Conger arrived from the Astros, while Matt Joyce came to Anaheim from Tampa Bay. Second baseman Johnny Giavotella would also be plucked from the Royals. The pitching staff remained unchanged for the most part; however, most of the pitchers had severely down years.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">For instance, 18-game winner Jered Weaver followed his 2014 campaign by going a horrid 7-12, with a sky-high 4.64 ERA to boot. Weaver’s second-in-command, Matt Shoemaker (who went 16-4 in 2014), crash-dived his way to a 7-10 record (with a 4.46 ERA) in 2015. Only Garrett Richards, the young star of the starting rotation, had a decent 2015, going 15-12 with a 3.65 ERA. C.J. had a lackluster season as well (8-8 record, 3.89 ERA) that was cut short due to a season-ending elbow surgery to his pitching arm.</p></div>

				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a href="http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2012/1001/mlb_allmlb_07.jpg" target="_blank">WWW.ESPN.COM</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">On the offensive end, Mike Trout and Albert Pujols had All-Star seasons as they homered their way atop the MLB leaderboards. But aside from Trout, Pujols, and Kole Calhoun (26 homers), the remaining portions of the lineup lacked both power and contact. All of the pitching troubles and the misfiring offensive unit created a topsy-turvy season for the Halos, who would finish in third place in their division (for the third time in C.J.’s first four years).</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>2016</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">On paper, the 2016 season should fare well for the Angels. Sure, the Rangers will welcome back Yu Darvish with open arms, and Darvish should slot in well with ace Cole Hamels. The Astros will look to continue their 2015 success, however, they did lose Scott Kazmir to the Dodgers. And the Athletics and the Mariners won’t cause too many problems, since their 2015 issues remain mostly uncorrected. But out of those two clubs, the Mariners can cause some upheaval in the division, since new GM Jerry Dipoto (who first signed C.J. to the Angels) went out and got Nori Aoki, Adam Lind, Chris Iannetta, and Leonys Martin.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">For the Angels, the misfiring trio of Wilson-Weaver-Shoemaker will return in full health, and Garrett Richards will resume his role as the new ace of the rotation. Should Weaver or Shoemaker tap into their 2014 form, the Angels will have one of the best starting pitching staffs in the division. If C.J. taps into his 2013 season, when he was virtually unbeatable in the second-half of that season, then the Halos may create some noise in that division.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Since this is the last year of C.J. Wilson’s 5-year, $77.5 million Angels contract, I will be watching each of his games and hoping his performances are tuned to channel 2013. The health concerns to his elbow seem to be relieved for the moment, and given his work ethic, he should start the 2016 season stronger than ever. Here’s to hoping that Year Five in the C.J. Wilson Experiment ends in a Nobel Prize. Or, you know, a World Series ring will work, too.</p></div>
