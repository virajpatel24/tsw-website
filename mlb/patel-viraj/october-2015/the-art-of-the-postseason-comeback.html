				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">Wrigley Field, Chicago, Illinois</p>
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">Wednesday, October 21st</p>
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">Game 4 - 8:07 PM EST on TBS</p>				
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Well, this is the moment of truth. Can the Chicago Cubs pull off a historic come-from-behind upset of the New York Mets in the NLCS? The Cubbies are down three games to the Mets, who are looking to end the series tonight at Wrigley. For all intents and purposes, the story has been written, the film has finished shooting, and the royalty checks are about to start pouring in for the Mets. Basically, the Cubs are all but eliminated.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">It was a nice run while it lasted. We got to see Joe Maddon, the hippest, old manager in MLB, rejuvenate the Cubs in only his first season in Chicago. Rookies Kris Bryant, Kyle Schwarber, Addison Russell, and Jorge Soler impressed us in every aspect this season. And the growing legend of Jake Arrieta surprised and enthralled in more ways than we can believe. But, as they say, all good things must come to an end.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But is this really the end for the Cubs? Surely, they still have <b>some</b> juice left in that gas tank? Is there any firepower left in those rookie offensive bats to supplant the Mets’ own offensive outbursts? Does Arrieta’s arm have enough sliders, fastballs, and control left? Will Wrigley’s ivy start devouring the Cubs’ baseballs for a change?</p></div>
				
				<div class="video_container"><iframe class="youtube_video" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/5rQSe0rLVV0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">All of those questions seem like a desperate attempt at making sense of a promising Cubs team that was able to rather convincingly neutralize both the St. Louis Cardinals and the Pittsburgh Pirates earlier in this postseason. However, there is still a slight, minuscule chance that the Cubs can win the next four games against the Mets and advance to their very first Fall Classic. But to get there, we must first examine what they already have (or lack thereof).</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The 2004 Boston Red Sox were the first (and only) team in MLB postseason history to come back when down three games. But in doing so, they left some blueprints for future teams to follow and the 2015 Cubs seem to possess most of the attributes needed to mount such a comeback.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">1. The Managers: Joe Maddon and Terry Francona</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Before joining the Cubs in 2015, Maddon took the Tampa Bay Rays to the 2008 World Series, so he certainly has the requisite experience needed to motivate and galvanize a young, underrated team to perform beyond its capabilities. Before joining the Boston Red Sox in 2004, Francona had experienced a massively unsuccessful stint while managing the Phillies. And his subservient roles while serving as an assistant for the Indians, Athletics, and the Rangers did not help much either.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In terms of managing style and ability, a 2015 Maddon clearly has the advantage over a 2004 Francona. Besides, the Sox already sported a 95–67 record in 2003 even despite being managed by the woefully inept Grady Little. The Boston club had even gone to the ALCS that year and went seven games against the Yankees before ultimately losing.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Conversely, the 2014 Cubs were dreadful. They finished 73–89 and showed very little signs of the transcendent baseball they’ve played in the 2015 season under Joe Maddon. In essence, Francona did a good job shepherding an already great to team the Fall Classic (and winning it), while Joe Maddon has taken an underachieving young team and transformed them into out-and-out winners in just under a year.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>ADVANTAGE:</b> 2015 Chicago Cubs</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">2. The Theo Epstein Factor</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Coincidentally, GM Theo Epstein has presided over both the 2004 Red Sox and now the 2015 Chicago Cubs. The 41-year-old is widely respected throughout MLB for his ability to construct a booming farm system as well as his courage in making the necessary roster shifts. The farm system Epstein concocted in Boston allowed the likes of Dustin Pedroia and Jacoby Ellsbury to rise to the major leagues. The farm system he’s created over the past few years with Chicago has allowed Addison Russell, Kyle Schwarber, and Kris Bryant (among many others) to rapidly ascend to the MLB level.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Epstein also made the controversial decision back in 2004 to ship the Sox’s star player Nomar Garciaparra to Chicago in a trade that brought shortstop Orlando Cabrera to Boston. Cabrera would play a pivotal role in reigniting the Sox offense and defense in 2004 while Garciaparra never regained his superstar form. That move was heavily criticized in New England when it occurred mid-2004, but Epstein had the foresight to know when to pull the trigger and, despite suffering the wrath of most of Boston at the time, the end-result — a World Series ring after 86 arduous years — washed away all his sins.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The same revamping of the roster has gone on in Chi-town. Epstein has brought in Jon Lester, Jake Arrieta, and others to the Windy City via either free agency or timely trades. Those key pieces, especially on the pitching side of things, have helped provide a veteran leadership and poise where none existed previously.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>ADVANTAGE:</b> Both teams</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">3. The Youth Chemistry vs. the Veteran Leadership</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The 2004 Red Sox were a veteran clubhouse full of “<a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2014/10/26/red-sox-idiots-end/301516972GrFBkOPSeFmUK/story.html" target="_blank">idiots</a>.” They laughed, partied, and fought their way to a World Series title. Their belief matched their hearts. Their craziness matched their desire. And their desire to create a dent in the Red Sox universe left a well-worn path that the 2015 Chicago Cubs can now follow.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Even though the Cubs lack that hard-core veteran leadership of the 2004 Sox, their cavalcade of rookies and youngsters is a nice puzzle to fit. However, the key factor that separates the 2004 Sox from the 2015 Cubs is that this  Cubs team has not really experienced heartbreak. As alluded to earlier, the 2003 Red Sox went all seven games with the New York Yankees in that year’s ALCS and, had it not been for some key blunders by Grady Little, the team would’ve advanced to the Fall Classic.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The pain and suffering of that close brush with November baseball left a huge, painful hole to fill for that 2003 Red Sox team. The next year, the Sox were hellbent on meeting up with the Yankees once again to prove that they were in fact the better team all along. This year’s Cubs team has not really had to contend with these types of heart-wrenching losses and, for that reason, winning four straight games may be a tougher ask for them given their youth and lack of postseason failures.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>ADVANTAGE:</b> 2004 Boston Red Sox</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">4. The Starting Pitching</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The 2015 Chicago Cubs have an absolute fire-breathing ace to throw at the Mets hitters in Jake Arrieta. But after a hot start to his postseason, Arrieta has cooled off in recent starts and the Cubs’ other pitchers are no match for the Mets’ trident of Matt Harvey, Jacob DeGrom, and Noah Syndergaard. Arrieta’s decline in performance comes at the worst time possible and it resides in stark contrast to the plaudits that were cast his way only a few weeks ago:</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“Somehow, it was all just a prelude for the destroyer of worlds [Arrieta’s] become in 2015. The final step in Arrieta’s progression was to coax better results out of his sinker, which began to rival what he was doing with his nasty breaking pitches. After batting .276 against his sinker last year, opponents have hit just .199 against it in 2015. This was the culmination of Arrieta’s trifecta of velocity, command, and movement: He could now put that pitch just about anywhere he wanted at any time, the same way he commanded his devastating slider and curve.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Jonah Keri, <em><a href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/2015-mlb-playoffs-jake-arrieta-dominance-chicago-cubs/" target="_blank">"The Sudden, Historic Dominance of Jake Arrieta"</a></em></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The 2004 Boston Red Sox had an established line-up of Pedro Martínez, Curt Schilling, and Tim Wakefield. The Sox bullpen was just as great with the likes of Alan Embree, Keith Foulke, Bronson Arroyo, Derek Lowe, and Mike Timlin taking care of business through that entire postseason run.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The Cubs, on the other hand, only have Héctor Rondón, Trevor Cahill, Fernando Rodney, and Clayton Richard, who are all decent players in their own right, but won’t be turning any heads during the “nail-biting” times of an eventual four straight Cubs NLCS wins. For the Cubbies to come out on top in the NLCS, they will need Arrieta to quickly return to his historic regular season form and Jon Lester, Jason Hammel, and Kyle Hendricks will need to provide at least five to six innings of solid pitching in every game they start.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>ADVANTAGE:</b> 2004 Boston Red Sox</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">5. The Historic Ballpark Advantage</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">With the amount of money being thrown into the MLB juggernaut, teams have chosen repeatedly to forego renovations and instead hold their home cities hostage over funding for an entirely new stadium. The Yankees are the most  recent example of a team that demolished their historic home for a new, shiny stadium right next door. In this day and age of “big money” baseball, the Cubs and the Red Sox stand as the last two teams that still have their original stadiums.</p></div>
				
				<img src="oct-mlb-article-images/wrigley-field.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a href="http://images.performgroup.com/di/library/sporting_news/1/f6/wrigley-field-082614-sn-ftrjpg_1madrr2f247mo1mcy24pal96jy.jpg?t=318003112" target="_blank">PERFORM GROUP</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The Red Sox’s Fenway Park has stood the test of time since 1912 while the Cubs’s Wrigley Field has been in business for the last 101 years. Each ballpark also has its own set of quirky physical attributes: Fenway has Pesky’s Pole and the Green Monster while Wrigley has the infamous ball-swallowing green ivy.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">While having a historic ballpark won’t provide enough ammo for a team down three games to launch a comeback, it will provide the historical backdrop of the importance of achieving such an awe-inspiring feat on their home turf. Would the 2004 Red Sox’s improbable postseason run have meant as much if the team owners had demolished Fenway two years earlier? Likewise, Wrigley’s place in history means something and it represents a consistent location that houses all of the Cubs’ nightmarish debacles over the last 101 years. And it would certainly benefit from a historic come-from-behind NLCS victory after all of these barren years.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>ADVANTAGE:</b> Both teams</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">6. The Upset</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This is perhaps the most enticing aspect of the entire Mets/Cubs match-up. In 2004, the Red Sox faced the other New York team and defeated them in seven games in the ALCS. In 2015, the Cubs face the New York Mets and have an equal opportunity to stage a historic comeback. Given the bitter nature of the Red Sox/Yankees rivalry, most MLB fans would argue that that 2004 ALCS upset will forever remain atop the very, very shortlist of teams who have pulled off such a feat.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“The Mets have never swept a best-of-seven postseason series. But they’re now a game away from sweeping this one. So that’s a slightly big deal.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Jayson Stark, <em><a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/playoffs2015/story/_/page/playoffs15_NLCSGame3/wacky-wrigley-night-mets-brink-fall-classic" target="_blank">"Weird, wacky Wrigley night has Mets on brink of Fall Classic"</a></em></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But the Cubs achieving a seven game NLCS victory over the Mets would be just as important and, in the historic sense, it would place them right up there with the 2004 Red Sox.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>ADVANTAGE:</b> Both teams</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The Cubs’ work is certainly cut out for them, and they have more than enough left in the tank to architect this improbable, inconceivable seven game NLCS heist on the Mets.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">All that remains to be seen is will they actually follow through? Or — the more likely case — will their 2015 postseason dreams get swallowed up just like those baseballs when they meet the Wrigley ivy?</p></div>
