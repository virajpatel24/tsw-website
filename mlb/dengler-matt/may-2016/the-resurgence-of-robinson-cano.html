				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Less than a year ago, very few among the Seattle Mariners fan base viewed star second baseman Robinson Canó favorably. After being signed to an exorbitant 10-year, $240 million contract by Seattle, and Canó enjoyed a stellar 2014 season. However, Canó experienced a drop in production during the 2015 season. Angry Seattle fans and media outlets had already labeled him an overpaid, aging veteran in decline. Though I am far from a Seattle Mariners fan, I shared in their frustration, too.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">After drafting Canó in the first round of my 2015 season-long fantasy baseball draft, I watched Canó struggle to make contact for the first half of the season, to the point where I had no choice but to drop him (life’s true hardships, am I right?). His batting average, home runs, on-base percentage, hard-contact percentage, and pretty much any other statistic you can name had fallen precipitously from his Yankee days, and he simply had not performed up to the level warranted by the fifth-largest contract in MLB history.</p></div>
				
				<img src="may-mlb-article-images/cano-stats.png" class="each_epl_image">
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But Canó didn’t magically lose his ability to hit a baseball on the flight from JFK to Sea-Tac. In fact, he had a phenomenal first season for the Mariners in 2014, <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_2014.shtml#AL_MVP_voting::none" target="_blank">finishing fifth in the American League MVP race</a> before enduring a brutal stretch during the first half of the 2015 season in which he hit .251 with only 6 home runs. However, he quickly caught fire after the All-Star break, hitting a scorching .331 and belting 15 more home runs till the season’s end.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Canó received more criticism than most other hitters mired in slumps due to his high-profile status, massive contract, and the Mariners’ disappointing season in 2015. Prior to that season there was widespread hope that the Mariners would contend for the World Series title. When they started lethargically and struggled to a 76-86 record, much of the blame was placed on Canó for his “unacceptable” level of play. The Seattle fans and media needed a scapegoat upon which to lay blame their team’s poor performance, and their franchise’s record signing was the logical choice.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“When things go well, people like everything you do. When things don’t go well, people look for 1,001 explanations, and they don’t understand you’re a human being.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2015/07/05/robinson-cano-acid-reflux-struggle-grandfather/29745307/" target="_blank">Robinson Canó</a></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But Robinson’s “down year” was nowhere near as dreadful as the countless articles written about his slump would lead you to believe. Apart from the multiple-month slump, the Mariners received essentially the exact hitter they paid $240 million to secure. And at least some of the slump can be explained. During the entire 2015 season Canó experienced extremely painful acid reflux in his stomach, which completely sapped his energy and forced him to limit his food intake. He also underwent surgery after the season to repair a double sports hernia he had played with during the prior season. Even Canó’s harshest critics wouldn’t argue that those injuries did not play a role in his slump and the “lack of effort” he at times seemed to exhibit. Rather than an aging veteran in decline, Canó looked more like an injured hitter toughing it out where others may have thrown in the towel. And his statistics suffered in the process.</p></div>
		
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“Sometimes I play without any strength or energy, but you have to play, give the best of yourself. Some people may say, ‘Canó, he’s listless.’ But (the energy) is not the same.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2015/07/05/robinson-cano-acid-reflux-struggle-grandfather/29745307/" target="_blank">Robinson Canó</a>, reflecting on the 2015 Season</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Canó’s play so far this season backs up my hypothesis. Right from Opening Day he has played like a man possessed, actively seeking to dispel any myths that he is no longer the same player from his Yankees days. In the process, he’s also attempting to win back the favor of the Mariners fans. And he’s done a damn good job thus far, leading the Mariners to their perch atop the AL West (27-18 record; 1.5 games ahead of the Texas Rangers) while placing himself among the top candidates for the American League MVP award.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The most obviously improved aspect of his play has been his power resurgence. Despite the fortress of a ballpark that the hot-hitting lefty calls home, Canó has had no problem taking opposing pitchers deep, already tallying 13 home runs and driving in an MLB-high 42 RBIs in just 45 games. His <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=3269&position=2B#battedball" target="_blank">advanced metrics</a> indicate that his current power surge may be here to stay. He is hitting fly balls on 40.3% of his batted balls, up from his meager 25.3% fly ball rate last season. This is an important number for a power hitter because, well, you can’t hit a home run on a ground-ball. Such a high fly ball rate, coupled with the power that Canó possesses, gives him ample chances to knock one into the cheap seats.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">His plate discipline has also improved this season. He’s swinging at better pitches and <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=3269&position=2B#battedball" target="_blank">making more contact when he swings</a>, lowering his career-high 2015 <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=3269&position=2B#platediscipline" target="_blank">swinging strike rate</a> to a more reasonable 7.5%. Potentially, most telling is the increase in Canó’s batted ball distance. In 2015, his <a href="http://www.baseballheatmaps.com/graph/distancenobuntleader.php" target="_blank">average distance on batted balls</a> was 185.92 feet. That number has increased to 206.49 feet this season. Though the sample size is still relatively small, such an improvement is an extremely good indicator that he is fully locked in at the plate. I could go on and on with the statistics, but you get the point. Keeping in mind that Canó’s 2015 season was far from a “bad” season, the improved numbers he is putting together this season appear even more astonishing.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Just to be clear, I don’t think these numbers are necessarily indicative of a drastically improved Robinson Canó. I believe that he is finally healthy, and finally able to play the way he’s played throughout his career. However, I do believe that the addition of lifetime Mariner and two-time batting champion Edgar Martínez as hitting coach has played a vital role in Robinson Canó’s continued success.</p></div>
			
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“Even though he was a gifted hitter, he was a guy who really broke down his swing, really understood his swing, really understood hitting in general. I think that’s the difference with a guy like that.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/15584224/edgar-martinez-helping-mariners-offense-coach" target="_blank">Dan Wilson</a>, Mariners instructor on Edgar Martínez</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Canó will be the first one to tell you about Martínez’s <a href="https://twitter.com/ryandivish/status/729150960984051716" target="_blank">massive impact on the organization</a>. Prior to Martinez taking over as hitting coach on June 20, 2015, the Mariners averaged 3.38 runs per game. The Mariners offense quickly caught fire <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/15584224/edgar-martinez-helping-mariners-offense-coach" target="_blank">under the guidance of Martínez</a> and averaged 4.53 runs the rest of the 2015 season. They’ve even upped that number to 4.60 runs per game so far this season. It’s no coincidence that Canó turned his 2015 season around almost as soon as he began working with Edgar Martínez.</p></div>
						
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“I knew how to play through it, but he helped me a lot,” Canó said. “He reminded of things, like, ‘Don’t forget who you are,’ and helped me out with things that I don’t want to tell people because you don’t want them to know your secrets, but he was really good.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/15584224/edgar-martinez-helping-mariners-offense-coach" target="_blank">Robinson Canó</a></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Canó, with the help of Martínez, made a few key adjustments to his swing that, along with finally being back to full health, have contributed to his success since the 2015 All-Star break. An earlier and more pronounced leg kick improved the star second baseman’s timing, while shifting more weight onto his back foot allowed him to <a href="https://twitter.com/MLB/status/720369782130774017/photo/1" target="_blank">generate more torque</a> and keep the barrel of the bat in the zone longer.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">While these were minor changes, Canó did undergo a major change to his swing. Between the 2014 and 2015 seasons, Canó’s swing path had mysteriously flattened rather dramatically. A flat swing path is more conducive to ground balls than fly balls, which as discussed earlier, contributed to the decline in his power numbers. But by working with Martínez, Canó has been able to add some lift to his swing, hitting up through the ball at a steeper angle while dropping the barrel of the bat slightly lower, increasing his fly ball rate and therefore his overall power numbers. The two swing comparisons below illustrate the adjustment, which has carried over from late-2015 into the early portion of the 2016 MLB season.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Robinson Canó has looked like a player reborn both on and off the field this season. He is bursting at the seams with an attribute that he was heavily criticized for lacking last season: Energy. Whether he’s fielding a routine ground ball, smacking a fastball to opposite field, or celebrating in the dugout, he has clearly regained the spark that was missing last year.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“Now that you’re healthy, you get to look back and see the difference. After what I went through last year, thank God I’m healthy. I’m able to use my body and move left and right, back and forth. That’s everything.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Robinson Canó</p>
				</div>
					
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">And in my opinion, Mariners fans should be almost as excited by this aspect of Robinson Canó’s turnaround as they are about the home runs and the league-leading RBI numbers. A franchise always wants their star player and biggest breadwinner to produce with his bat, however, they also need him to be a leader in the dugout as well. Now that he’s finally at full health and back to a positive mindset, Canó has checked both of those boxes with authority in this young season.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Whether he’s <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/bob-nightengale/2016/03/31/robinson-cano-mariners-2016-andy-van-slyke/82488824/" target="_blank">picking up the tab</a> for the team’s pool table, steaks, and lobster or <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/sports/mariners/culture-is-the-key-for-mariners-new-regime/" target="_blank">urging his teammates</a> to buy into the new culture instilled by manager Scott Servais, Canó has done everything he can to set a good example for his teammates and continue the franchise’s surge towards the postseason. The boos have been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b9rOji_PWY" target="_blank">left to bitter Yankee fans</a>, having long been replaced by ear-splitting chants of “MVP” echoing across Seattle’s Elliott Bay.</p></div>
