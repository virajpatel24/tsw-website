				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">It doesn’t take a genius to realize that the 2015-16 Cleveland Cavaliers will be great. OK, let’s be honest, it’s clear they are the BEST team in the Eastern Conference. In fact, this just might be the best team that LeBron James has ever laced up with. It’s abundantly evident that this team will have more depth and talent than any of LeBron’s teams in Miami. Although the Cavaliers have a lot going for them, they will require some help along the way.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">First and foremost, they will need to remain healthy. The “Big Three” - LeBron, Kevin Love, and Kyrie Irving - missed 27 games last year during the regular season. Health wasn’t the only issue for the Cavaliers early on in the 2014-15 season as chemistry issues got the team off to a rocky 19-20 start. This time around, the cast and characters already have a year under their belt with coach David Blatt. Add to that a successful 2014-15 postseason that saw Cleveland almost win the NBA Finals, and it’s clear that the team should be primed for a promising deep run once more. Last but not least, the Cavs will need to rely on their depth in order to stay competitive. The Eastern Conference won’t be a cakewalk for the Cavaliers, despite popular belief.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Many of the big-time superstars that were out for large swathes of time last season are now fully healthy and ready to lead their teams once again. Paul George, Carmelo Anthony, and Chris Bosh are all back on the court for the Pacers, Knicks, and Heat, respectively. LeBron and company will need everyone on the team to play a key role. Speaking of the King, LeBron is a year older and he already has a ton of miles on his body given that he joined the league at the ripe age of 18.  With new signings of veterans Richard Jefferson and Mo Williams, combined with the return of Anderson Varejão from a ruptured Achilles tendon, Cleveland has the right blend of youth and experience to bring home the Larry O’Brien trophy.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Team Health</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">There’s no doubt that the Cavaliers must remain healthy in order to have a successful season. One could make the case that had Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving been available for the 2015 NBA Finals, Cleveland would have won it all. I mean the Cavaliers did take the Warriors to six games with Matthew Dellavedova as their starting point guard for the final five games of the series. Just imagine what a healthy Love and Kyrie would have done for LeBron’s efficiency.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Sure, he might not have averaged an absurd 35.8 PPG during the series with Love and Kyrie around, but King James would have gotten more rest. In fact, during the postseason, LeBron <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/team/stats/_/name/cle/year/2015/seasontype/3/cleveland-cavaliers" target="_blank">led the team in points, rebounds, assists, and steals</a>. I don’t care who you are, that’s asking a lot out of anyone, including a player of LeBron James’s caliber. Good news poured in for Cleveland this summer, however, as they signed some veteran players in Richard Jefferson and Mo Williams to help provide some needed depth for the “Big Three” during key stretches of the season.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Team Chemistry</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Chemistry issues plagued the Cavaliers throughout the previous season. From coach Blatt’s inability to gain respect from the team to Love’s frustration with his passive role in the offense, making it to the NBA Finals created the classic Hollywood-esque ending for the Cavaliers, but the plot in between wasn’t pretty.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">David Blatt won the NBA Rookie Coach’s lottery thanks to having the best player the game has to offer in LeBron James already signed to his team. Having Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love also made things comparatively easier for him. However, the job came with many seen and unforeseen challenges. LeBron became frustrated with Blatt initially and stayed that way throughout the season. The King’s <a href="../../patel-viraj/october-2015/2015–2016-nba-eastern-conference-preview.html">passive-aggressive feelings</a> reached a boiling point during the postseason as the short-handed Cavs went into overdrive trying to survive against Golden State’s barrage of court spacing and efficient shots.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In the pivotal Game 4 against the Chicago Bulls during the Eastern Conference semi-finals, Coach Blatt drew up a play during the final seconds of the game with LeBron inbounding the ball to another player.  I know, you’re probably saying, “What was Blatt thinking to allow anyone but LeBron to shoot the final shot of the game?” LeBron scratched the play and called his own number. Oh, and he went on to drill a clutch dagger that ultimately sent the Cavaliers to the Conference Finals.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">David Blatt isn’t the only one King James had an issue with. The best basketball player in the world also took thinly-veiled jabs at Kevin Love, who struggled to fit into a team loaded with stars. To make things more interesting, LeBron expressed his thoughts via Twitter on Love’s involvement (or lack thereof) with the team rather than addressing them privately with Love.</p></div>
				
				<a href="https://twitter.com/KingJames/status/564281844271947777" target="_blank"><img src="oct-nba-article-images/lebron-james-tweet.png" class="each_epl_image"></a>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Prior to joining the Cavs, Kevin Love had posted a ridiculous 26.1 PPG and 12.5 RPG with the Minnesota Timberwolves during the 2013-14 season. It’s easy to understand why Love’s first year in Cleveland took some adjusting as he went from being the number one option on a sub-par Timberwolves team to becoming the third option on a loaded Cavaliers roster. With several roster additions over this offseason and another season under their belt, the Cavaliers will need to continue to improve their chemistry in order to position themselves for the inevitable deep playoff run. And that chemistry experiment will succeed and/or fail depending on how the head chemist, LeBron James, goes about conducting it.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Team Depth</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This offseason, the Cavaliers added two key veterans in Mo Williams and Richard Jefferson to complement their already strong nucleus. Williams and Jefferson aren’t washed up veterans either. Williams, who last played for the Charlotte Hornets, dropped 52 points last season against the Indiana Pacers, proving that he can still play with the best PGs in the NBA. Jefferson will back-up James at the small forward position and can go stretches guarding the other team’s best player, offering James the additional rest he can use in order to leave his mark during the fourth quarters of tightly-contested games.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This Cavs team will also get veteran Anderson Varejão back this year, adding a nice blanket of depth to a talented roster. The Brazilian missed 56 regular season games last year due to a torn Achilles. Varejão, who has been with the Cavaliers for the last 11 years, will provide great flexibility and depth in the frontcourt for Coach Blatt. With Tristan Thompson and Timofey Mozgov already in the rotation, Blatt can now pick and choose a myriad of lineups with Kevin Love as the focal point in the offense so James can limit his minutes and rest up for the postseason.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Mike Greenberg, from Mike and Mike, believes that LeBron James’ MVP days should be over. On his radio show on October 23, 2015, Greenberg stated that LeBron will not play enough minutes this season to repeat his ridiculous stat lines from seasons past, which will not keep him in the contention for the MVP award. It’s difficult to imagine a perennial MVP candidate like King James not posting triple-double numbers every night, but with Love’s increasing role in the offense and with the implementation of key role players, James could see a decrease across the board in his stat line this regular season. It’s an interesting sacrifice to make for a player still ensconced in the prime of his career, but it’s a move fit for a King that has studied the entire chessboard many times over.</p></div>
