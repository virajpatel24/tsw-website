				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The Phoenix Suns, like most teams trying to contend for a NBA title, currently field a roster that houses at least three or more top 50 players. No, not in terms of actual skill, but, instead, <a href="http://www.spotrac.com/nba/rankings/" target="_blank">in terms of yearly salary</a>. In one of those “scary, but it’s true” moments, the Suns have locked down Eric Bledsoe, Brandon Knight, and Tyson Chandler for around $13 million a season per each individual. While neither of those three contracts mirror the monstrosities that the Lakers ($25 million for an aging Kobe Bryant), Nets (close to $25 million for a decrepit Joe Johnson), Bulls ($20 million for a lost Derrick Rose), OKC ($16.4 million for Enes Kanter <a href="https://twitter.com/Enes_Kanter/status/692576529721774080" target="_blank">and his goatee</a>), Celtics ($15.5 million for David Lee…wait, the Celtics are <em>still</em> overpaying Lee?!?!), and Hornets ($13.5 million for Al Jefferson, who has had the same production this season as <a href="http://www.nba.com/lakers/news/160127shaq_statue" target="_blank">Shaq’s future Lakers statue</a>) all have, the Suns’ trio has not exactly dazzled their supporters, either.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Sure, the 33-year-old Tyson Chandler just had a monster game against the Atlanta Hawks recently, when he posted 13 points, 27 rebounds, five assists, two blocks, and a steal to boot, in 44 minutes of court time. But since the “33-year-old” part is pretty important here, Chandler followed up on that elite performance by posting five points, five rebounds, and a lone assist  in 19 minutes against the Sixers this past Tuesday night. After 34 creaky minutes against the Cavs on Wednesday night, Chandler only had six points, seven rebounds, three assists, and four turnovers to show for it. Not exactly what you’d call “consistent.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">And that’s not a knock on Mr. Chandler, who I loved watching when he played for the Charlotte HorBobCatNets in the 2009–10 season. Chandler’s performances are simply the low returns you’d expect out of someone who came into the league from high school and has already logged 27,000+ minutes on those knees. Besides, Chandler is a world champion already — he was on the Mavericks team that stampeded King James’s initial Heat team in the 2011 NBA Finals — so he has nothing more to really prove or achieve.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The same, however, cannot be said for Chandler’s young co-stars, Eric Bledsoe and Brandon Knight. Bledsoe, after bidding adieu to John Calipari’s Kentucky with a one-and-done season in 2009–10, was drafted with the 18th overall pick by the Oklahoma City Thunder, which would have been great for them, except…they immediately dealt him to the woebegone Los Angeles Clippers, who were one season away from bringing CP3 into the fold. After battling through some injury issues early on, Bledsoe finally broke through in his third season in LA and by the start of his fourth, he was already headed for drier pastures in Phoenix. In his first season with the Suns, Bledsoe only played in 43 games (starting 40 of those), but posted a healthy stat line of 17.7 PTS, 5.5 AST, and 4.7 REB, which was a significant spike from his Clippers’ career stat line of 6.2 PTS, 2.8 AST, 2.5 REB.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">He then followed up on that debut Suns season by signing a new <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/11583579/eric-bledsoe-phoenix-suns-agree-five-year-contract" target="_blank">five-year, $70 million contract</a> in the offseason, which proved to be well-deserved, since he improved his stat line to 17.0 PTS, 6.1 AST, and 5.2 REB while, most importantly, starting 81 games. This season, Bledsoe was on his way to a superb season (20.4 PTS, 6.1 AST, 4.0 REB, and 2.0 STL) before he underwent a meniscus repair surgery on December 29, 2015, which will sideline him for the remainder of the Suns’ 2015–16 campaign.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">His running mate, Brandon Knight, took a more circuitous path to Phoenix, Arizona. Knight first plied his trade for the Pistons in 2011–13 before moving on to the Milwaukee Bucks. On trade deadline day of the 2014–15 season, Knight was involved in a blockbuster three-team trade that sent him and Kendall Marshall to Phoenix, Tyler Ennis, Miles Plumlee, and Michael Carter-Williams to Milwaukee, while the Sixers latched onto the Los Angeles Lakers’ protected 2015 first-round pick that the Suns had previously owned. Knight, who had arrived to Calipari’s Kentucky after Bledsoe had already departed, also engineered a successful one-and-done season before hitting the ground running in Detroit. He’s stayed relatively healthy this season, though he did suffer a groin injury that will keep him sidelined for a few more games.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">While the Suns certainly miss the Bledsoe-Knight tandem — which was averaging a blistering combined stat line of 40.1 PTS, 11.2 AST, 7.7 REB, and a PER of 35.99 on a nightly basis — they can take solace in the fact that the 21-year-old Archie Goodwin and the 19-year-old Devin Booker are more than capably filling the giant void. Instead of being the flaky stopgap they were projected to be all along, Goodwin and Booker (yet <em>another</em> Kentucky duo the Suns have, I might mention) have architected a combined stat line of 37.8 PTS, 7.4 AST, 4.8 REB over the last five games, as their minutes have increased.</p></div>

				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a href="https://www.facebook.com/suns/photos/pb.45898408995.-2207520000.1454097775./10153863798213996/" target="_blank">PHOENIX SUNS FACEBOOK ACCOUNT</a></p>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Their six combined turnovers per game are a bit disconcerting, but since the Suns only trail the dreadful Sixers in team turnovers (<a href="http://stats.nba.com/league/team/#!/?sort=TOV&dir=1" target="_blank">the Sixers lead the league with 17.9 per game</a>, while the Suns follow up with 16.8 of their own), it makes sense that the games of these two budding stars mirror that of their surrounding, turnover-prone environment. Oh, and speaking of “dreadful,” there’s one tiny matter at hand that merits some addressing: The Phoenix Suns, as of Jan. 29, sport a 14–33 record. In fact, the Suns were not much better when Bledsoe was around, since they were stewing in a meager 12–21 record on Dec. 29, the day Bledsoe went in for his meniscus repair surgery.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Despite their significantly-below-.500 record, the Suns still hover around “average” as a team in most statistical measures. Average points per game? 101.4, 17th-best in the NBA.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Steals per game? 8.4, 7th-best.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Offensive rebounds per game? 10.5, 14th-best.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Rebounds per game? 42.8, 20th-best.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Free throw attempts per game? 22.1, 22nd-best…which isn’t a knock on the Suns since the 39–7 San Antonio Spurs, 26–22 Dallas Mavericks, and 27–21 Atlanta Hawks all rank below them.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Field goals made? 48.1 per game, 17th-best.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Field goals attempted? 85.3, 10th-best.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">3’s made? 9.3 per game, 7th-best.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">3’s attempted? 25.1, 11th-best.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">So, why do the Suns keep losing so much even when Bledsoe and Knight are around? Why do they continue to be a raging tire fire when Goodwin and Booker appear as the Suns’ next breed of Kentucky saviors?</p></div>

				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a href="https://www.facebook.com/suns/photos/pb.45898408995.-2207520000.1454097775./10153873327138996/" target="_blank">PHOENIX SUNS FACEBOOK ACCOUNT</a></p>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The Suns’ issues live and die with turnovers (as mentioned, they turn the ball over close to 17 times per game), porous defending (<a href="http://stats.nba.com/league/team/defense/#!/?sort=D_FG_PCT&dir=1" target="_blank">highest defensive field goal percentage in the league</a> at 47.5%, which means 47.5% of opposition shots convert when the Suns are involved), and even more porous defending when it comes to 3’s. Although the Suns are among the league leaders when it comes to converting and attempting threes, they are equally as inept at DEFENDING those threes — they allow 9.4 threes a night, which somehow still only ranks in second, thanks to the Sacramento “What? Play defense? Get outta here!” Kings, who allow a stunning 10.4 threes a game.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This is the next evolution for Jeff Hornacek and the Phoenix Suns. They have to find some sort of rim protection, which Chandler was supposed to provide, but again…33 years old…what more can the guy give you at that age??? Apparently, not much. Additionally, those turnovers have to be whittled away. The Suns can keep committing those turnovers if their offense can make up for it, but with Bledsoe and Knight out, that simply is not a reality. Despite having the league’s better records, the Warriors, Thunder, Pacers, Hawks, and Rockets still reside with the Suns <a href="http://stats.nba.com/league/team/#!/?sort=TOV&dir=1" target="_blank">when it comes to turning the ball over</a>. But those teams ultimately succeed because they have thundering offenses that can make up for those shortcomings. The Suns simply can’t afford to take those risks with a mediocre offense and a bottom-of-the-charts defense.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Heading towards the summer, the Suns will have a high lottery pick, max cap space to dangle at free agents, a few trade chips, as well as a burgeoning youth core. So the Suns and their fans have reason to believe in the future, but they also have an incredibly long way to go and many areas to fix — actually <b>FIX</b>…and not just patch over those massive leaks willy nilly by signing 33-year-old former defensive presences — before they are true contenders in the West once more.</p></div>
