				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Viraj:</b> Before we get started, Matt, I think we should keep two things in mind: First, no matter how badly we mess up on a draft choice, it will still beat out whatever the Washington Wizards were doing when they decided to mortgage their future on Jan Veselý. Second, if nothing else, we will have created an absolute powerhouse in Cleveland (first and fourth picks) by the end of this draft. Those two things alone should buoy our confidence as we make our (many) mistakes and miscalculations throughout this draft.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">A couple of ground rules will help.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">1. The players we select will be selected based on their career up to present day. So, we take into account Jimmy Butler’s success with the Bulls and we also account for Markieff Morris’s tumultuous times in Phoenix. Hindsight and this present-day knowledge will be taken into account for our draft choices.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">2. We draft the player based on the selecting team’s present day roster. So, for instance, since LeBron James already plays for the Cavaliers, we don’t need to pick a small forward for Cleveland when they have holes at shooting guard and center that can be filled via a 2011 NBA Re-Draft pick.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">3. No trades or trading of draft rights are in play. If the Chicago Bulls have the 30th pick, I can’t pick on their behalf and then immediately trade that pick/draftee elsewhere in our fictionalized NBA world. So, no trades.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">4. Finally, if a player who was drafted in the 2011 Draft currently actually plays on a 2015-16 team, then if we select him for another team via this Re-Draft, he would no longer be on the 2015-16 team. So, we can draft Markieff again for the Suns in this Re-Draft and he would end up in Phoenix again via a happy coincidence. But if we draft Kyrie to the Bobcats in this Re-Draft, then he no longer plays for the Cavs in real life. And the next time we pick for the Bobcats, we would have to keep in mind that Kyrie now plays for them, thanks to our Re-Draft.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Do those four rules make sense, Matt?</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Matt:</b> Yes, they do. And that sounds like a good game-plan. Let us begin. With the first overall pick of the 2011 NBA Draft, on behalf of the Cleveland Cavaliers, I draft <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/6430/jimmy-butler" target="_blank"><b>Jimmy Butler</b></a>, shooting guard out of Marquette University. I think Butler is the best player to come out of this draft, and is, in my humble opinion, the best shooting guard in the NBA. At the very least, he is the most well-rounded. In addition to being a top defender, he is averaging 22.4 points, 5.2 rebounds, 4.3 assists, and 1.7 steals in a whopping 38 minutes per game this season. With the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/sort/RPM/position/2" target="_blank">second-highest “Real +/-” statistic</a> for a shooting guard this season, less than 0.1 behind leader James Harden, Butler would be more valuable to the Cavaliers than any other player in this draft.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Viraj:</b> Jimmy Buckets is a solid choice, especially given how well he would slot in with the Cavaliers’ current roster featuring LeBron James and Kevin Love (remember Kyrie, who is a member of this 2011 draft class, is not on this 2015-16 Cavs team). At the second overall pick, on behalf of the Minnesota Timberwolves, I select <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/6450/kawhi-leonard" target="_blank"><b>Kawhi Leonard</b></a>, small forward out of San Diego State University. Kawhi’s NBA career has fully bloomed in San Antonio under Gregg Popovich. The Spurs’ pass-happy, constantly-moving system does wonders for Kawhi’s game.</p></div>
				
				<img src="mar-nba-article-images/kawhi.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a href="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/kawhi-leonard-anatomy-of-a-deal.jpg" target="_blank">GRANTLAND</a></p>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But by picking him second, Kawhi does go to an organization that had the infamous David Kahn as their GM (Minnesota went a league-worst 89-223 (.285) during Kahn's tenure) and aside from Kevin Garnett, the Wolves haven’t exactly developed young talents left-and-right. So, I can see the T-Wolves completely keeping Kawhi rooted to their bench in his early years and messing up his development (remember it took Kawhi a few seasons to build up his current offensive repertoire). But, hopefully, Kawhi Leonard’s <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/sort/DRPM/position/5" target="_blank">superb defense</a>, combined with Andrew Wiggins, Zach LaVine, Ricky Rubio, and Karl Anthony-Towns, should helped create a budding superstar team in the frozen Minnesota Tundra.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Matt:</b> Using the third pick of the Utah Jazz, I will select <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/6442" target="_blank"><b>Kyrie Irving</b></a>, point guard out of Duke University. I realize this pick (and my next pick) may be contentious due to my passing on Klay Thompson multiple times, but I feel that with the Jazz’s current roster construction, Kyrie offers them the most value. Irving, an explosive point guard by nature, is also able to shoot the long ball, while maintaining excellency in the midrange. Oh, and being an elite finisher at the rim doesn’t hurt, either.</p></div>
				
				<div class="video_container"><iframe class="youtube_video" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Mr_WjR6iaj4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Known for his dazzling handles and an unrivaled ability to create his own shot, Kyrie is an underrated distributor, drawing defenders and opening up space for his teammates. Kyrie’s only notable flaw is his lack of defensive ability, an aspect of his game that he would benefit greatly from improving. An explosive, up-tempo ball-handler like Kyrie Irving would do wonders for the the Utah Jazz, the team with <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/hollinger/teamstats/_/sort/paceFactor" target="_blank">the slowest pace of play in the NBA</a>, and could bump them into that top tier of teams in the West. Deciding between Jimmy Butler and Kyrie Irving for the first overall pick was a tough decision for me, but I went with Butler for his superior defensive abilities.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Viraj:</b> Since the Cavs already have Jimmy Butler (who Matt drafted with the first overall pick) at SG, LeBron James at SF, and Kevin Love at PF, it makes sense to splurge on either a center or a point guard with this fourth overall pick. Considering the wide array of available point guards in the 2011 draft class, I will pick <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/6472" target="_blank"><b>Isaiah Thomas</b></a>, a 5’9” point guard out of the University of Washington. In the actual 2011 NBA Draft, Thomas was the 60th and final player selected, and if we fast-forwarded to February 2016, we would witness Mr. Thomas playing in his first All-Star game in Toronto. Not bad for a diminutive, passed-over-59-times point guard who had all odds stacked against him from the get-go. And he would have instantly created a “Big Four” in Cleveland with LeBron, Jimmy Butler, and Kevin Love.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Matt, we’re already four picks in and neither of us has thought to pick Klay Thompson, will you do the honors?</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Matt:</b> I can’t believe I’m saying this (and will probably regret this immediately) but I’m gonna have to pass on Klay again. And don’t get me wrong I think Klay is a fantastic player and more than worthy of a top five selection, but he doesn’t offer the same value to the Toronto Raptors that <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/6478" target="_blank"><b>Nikola Vučević</b></a>, a center from the University of Southern California, brings to the table.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">(Quick side note, the “lint roller promotion” the Raptors ran during the 2014 playoffs is easily the greatest fan promotion ever created. If you don’t know the backstory, they decided to poke a little fun at their hometown hero, Drake, for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WUnlV6I5kk" target="_blank">this incident</a> a few days prior.)</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Anyways, let’s get back on track. The 2015-16 Raptors already have DeMar DeRozan and DeMarre Carroll occupying the positions where Klay Thompson would fit best, and while he would be an improvement over either player, the most important improvement can be made in the frontcourt with the addition of Vučević. Since both current Raptors centers - Jonas Valančiūnas and Bismack Biyombo - were also taken in this draft, Toronto’s roster would be devoid of a quality center. Though potentially a slight reach, this is a nice place to take Vooch, who is the top center available with potential as high as most. Vooch’s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxGOM4MrCRs&t=0m39s" target="_blank">excellent post moves</a> and <a href="http://www.nba.com/magic/film-room-nikola-vucevics-high-basketball-iq" target="_blank">high basketball IQ</a>, when combined with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-6wqZZ1DZs" target="_blank">tiny bit of flash</a> and his outstanding midrange game (which lends itself perfectly to the pick-and-pop), really show the unbounded potential that teams salivate over.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">So Viraj, are you FINALLY going to stop the madness and take Klay Thompson?</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Viraj:</b> Yes, I will do the honors and select <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/6475" target="_blank"><b>Klay Thompson</b></a> on the behalf of the Washington Wizards with the sixth overall pick. While I still can’t believe Klay fell all the way to sixth in this Re-Draft, I have full faith that he will thrive in a backcourt already featuring John Wall and Bradley Beal. Klay, at 6’7” and 215 lbs, is also versatile enough to allow the Wizards to slot him in at small forward, which would allow Beal and Wall to retain their natural positions. Looking ahead to the next pick...Matt, it looks like you’re going to be in charge of fixing the messy, combustible Sacramento Kings! I wonder if this is a perfect time to add to that mess by <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/12735869/marcus-morris-markieff-morris-phoenix-suns-charged-felony-assault" target="_blank">adding yet another fiery forward</a> to the mix...one of the Morris twins, perhaps?</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Matt:</b> I think I’ll stay away from the Morris twins for now, Markieff’s antics worry me too much and I think there’s still a better forward on the board than Marcus. His name is <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/6466" target="_blank"><b>Chandler Parsons</b></a>, a small forward out of the University of Florida, and I’m selecting him for the Sacramento Kings. I believe Parsons is a better player than either of the Morris twins, and far less of a distraction both on and off the court than Markieff. Parsons is currently a complete player for the Mavericks. He has proven he can contribute greatly on offense and score efficiently without needing to dominate possession. This is a perfect fit for the Kings, who already have two quality scoring options in Demarcus Cousins and Rudy Gay. The <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/yoEhjNnsUA/" target="_blank">most handsome player in the NBA</a> offers the Kings the best bang-for-their-buck and highest value of the remaining players.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">With Detroit acquiring talented forward Tobias Harris earlier this week, how will you add to an up-and-coming Pistons team with the eighth pick in the draft?</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Viraj:</b> Wait, since when is Chandler Parsons the most handsome player in the NBA?!?! Are we talking about <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BBlL5FZHsSa/?taken-by=chandlerparsons" target="_blank">the same guy</a>? Additionally, I think <a href="http://view.official.nike.com/?j=fecb117370640779&m=fe9a1570736c047874&ls=fe1e15777d630778761d76&l=ff3116737662&s=fe2015767d61057f7c1279&jb=ff3915727567&ju=fe5e1678736502757415" target="_blank">Kawhi “Derek” Zooleonard</a> just might have something to say about this. You know, if he says anything at all. I’ve never seen that guy speak.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Anyways, in reality, the Pistons used the eighth pick on Brandon Knight; however, despite Knight’s offensive prowesses, I will opt for a point guard the Pistons already have: <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/6443" target="_blank"><b>Reggie Jackson</b></a>. Reggie is having a career year so far - he’s averaging 19.3 points, 6.1 assists, and 3.3 rebounds per game - in Motor City under Stan Van Gundy. He started out his career in Oklahoma City and his trajectory mirrored that of James Harden’s a little bit. In his first two seasons, Jackson averaged only 12.7 minutes a night and given Russell Westbrook’s dominance, that made sense. But Jackson played his way into the Scott Brooks’s lineups at the start of his third year, seeing his minutes spike up to 28.5 that same season. And now, with a full season completed in Detroit (he has started in 87 games for the Pistons as of March 4, 2016), his development only looks to progress. Great pickup by Detroit and Stan Van the Man.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Matt, looks like you have to assume the role of Michael Jordan next, are you ready to channel your inner Airness?</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Matt:</b> Yes, I am! I feel fairly confident I could do a better job drafting players than Michael Jordan has done, especially since we have a working understanding of the potentials of most of the top players in the 2011 Draft. But believe it or not, Jordan actually got it right when he drafted <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/6479" target="_blank"><b>Kemba Walker</b></a> in 2011, so I’m also going to stick with the electrifying point guard out of the University of Connecticut. Kemba has been a revelation for the Hornets, averaging 17 points per game throughout his career with the Hornets. During the current NBA season, he’s improved that mark to 20.8 points per game, while dishing out 5.1 assists and 4.4 rebounds, too. He has helped bring the Hornets from <a href="http://www.nba.com/2012/news/04/26/michael-jordan-struggles.ap/" target="_blank">the worst team in NBA history</a> (at this point they were still the Bobcats), to a capable team sitting only five games out of third place in the Eastern Conference. There is no doubt that the Hornets are Walker’s team, and picking anyone else here instead of Kemba would be disadvantageous for M.J. and the Hornets.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Viraj:</b> Okay, so I have Milwaukee’s pick to choose now. While the Knicks fans may have been chanting “We want Jimmer! We want Jimmer!” at the tail end of their Tuesday evening’s humbling 104-85 loss to the Trail Blazers at MSG, I will definitely stay a couple thousand zip codes away from Jimmer Fredette (who the Bucks drafted and then immediately traded to the Kings) while selecting on behalf of the Bucks. The best option for the Bucks here is to select <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/6433" target="_blank"><b>Kenneth Faried</b></a>, who currently plays for the Denver Nuggets and is averaging a healthy stat line of 12.5 points, 8.7 rebounds, and 0.9 blocks per game. With their current 25-36 record, the Bucks have been the biggest disappointment of this season, but given the parity in the East this year, they are still only six games out of the final playoffs spot. As usual, head coach Jason <a href="https://youtu.be/vEqU7JHkfu0" target="_blank">“Hit Me, Hit Me”</a> Kidd continues his quirky antics by playing a starting five of O.J. “Juice” Mayo, Khris Middleton, Giannis “Greek Freak” Antetokounmpo, Jabari Parker, and Miles Plumlee.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Yes, in case you’re wondering, this leaves Greg Monroe and Michael Carter-Williams on the bench at tip-off. But that weird lineup seems to be doing something, if that “something” is going 5-5 in the last ten games. And that’s where Faried can help out. His <a href="http://stats.nba.com/league/player/defense/#!/?Season=2015-16&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&TeamID=1610612743&sort=D_FG_PCT&dir=1" target="_blank">rim protection abilities</a> are not up to par, and his offensive game can stand to improve. But the man’s called “The Manimal” for a reason. He can crash the boards, collect offensive rebounds (resulting in second-chance opportunities), and he can easily contribute on pick-and-roll cycles with Mayo, Greek Freak, and Carter-Williams. Faried could have easily helped this Bucks team operate at a .500 level, even with a character like Jason Kidd at the helm.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Matt:</b> From one end of the coaching spectrum to the other, let’s head to Steve Kerr’s Warriors for the 12th pick in the 2011 NBA draft. Since the Warriors’s original pick, Klay Thompson, has already been drafted by the Washington Wizards, I will select <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/13942794/cleveland-cavaliers-tristan-thompson-agree-5-year-82-million-deal" target="_blank">the most overpaid player</a> in the NBA, <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/6474" target="_blank"><b>Tristan Thompson</b></a>, forward from the University of Texas, for the Golden State Warriors. While Thompson is a talented player, great on the offensive glass and a stingy defender down low, the Cavaliers reached on him in 2011 to draft him with the fourth pick. However, I think the Warriors are a borderline perfect fit for Thompson, and drafting him with the twelfth pick makes sense. Thompson’s offensive rebounding and defensive prowess would bolster an already incredible Warriors team, whose only real weakness is a lack of frontcourt depth.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Capable of playing both power forward and center, Thompson could also be a perfect fit for the small-ball lineup often employed by the Warriors. While not an extremely gifted offensive weapon, TT’s proficiency on the offensive glass could create more second-chance shots for Stephen Curry, especially when running the small-ball lineup that, at times, can struggle to rebound.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Viraj:</b> So, the Utah Jazz are in a precarious position in this Re-Draft of ours. With a starting lineup of Raul(zinho) Neto, Rodney <a href="http://basketball.realgm.com/analysis/240936/How-Rodney-Hood-Could-Go-From-Utilitarian-Cog-To-Budding-All-Star" target="_blank">“Next James Harden”</a> Hood, Gordon “Hair Still Perfect” Hayward, Derrick “You’ll Get No” Favors, and Rudy “Stifle Tower” Gobert, they really don’t need a “star” out of this draft. In fact, as the Philadelphia 76ers have demonstrated, having too many youngsters jockeying for playing time can stunt the development of the others. This is why I will take a player the Jazz already possess named <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/6429" target="_blank"><b>Alec Burks</b></a>, who had a stellar college career playing for the neighboring state’s University of Colorado.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Burks has done reasonably well thus far in his Jazz career, and with some more healthy stints, his already consistent skills should help create a bit more pizazz for the Jazz.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Matt, you have the Phoenix Suns coming up. Will you finally find a suitable replacement for Goran Dragić and Steve Nash?</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Matt:</b> I plan to do just that. With the 13th pick for the Phoenix Suns I will select <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/6448" target="_blank"><b>Brandon Knight</b></a>, a point guard from the University of Kentucky. While originally drafted by the Pistons in 2011, he currently plays for the Suns. Though he’s famous for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sx_97RTPcKA" target="_blank">“series of unfortunate events”</a> that have befallen him throughout his NBA career, he’s actually a very talented player and a good fit for the current Phoenix team. Prior to his injury, Knight was averaging just under 20 points and more than five assists per game after 42 games this season. A talented scorer with the ability to both shoot and drive to the basket, he is the type of offensive weapon the Suns need to have in order to have a chance at any success. In the time that Knight has been out with a groin injury, the Suns have gone 2-16 (15-46 record overall), proving Knight’s worth and value.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">I feel like the draft has gone pretty well for both of us so far, wouldn’t you say? I’m beginning to  regret passing on Klay Thompson, but I stand by my decisions based on the need of the Jazz and Raptors. So Viraj, who are you gonna pick to improve the always entertaining Houston Rockets?</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Viraj:</b> Yes, I’m quite pleased with our choices. And worry not, you passed on Klay Thompson <em>while</em> selecting the NBA’s best two-way shooting guard in Jimmy Butler, a former All-Star Game MVP in Kyrie Irving, and the cornerstone of the current Magic squad in Nikola Vučević. Those are all solid picks and taking Klay at sixth made the most sense, given the superb backcourt that would have created in Chocolate City (Wall, Beal, <em>and</em> Klay).</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">As for the Rockets, well all I can say is I’ll try and account for the “human being” side of things as well as the analytics stuff, which is something Daryl Morey can’t really say he’s done. I mean why else would he bring in Jeremy Lin, Dwight Howard, Josh Smith (twice! TWICE!!), and then completely whiff on Ty Lawson? For all his genius, Morey simply hasn’t been as successful in predicting the human element of things, which is cemented by the fact that he took Marcus Morris as the 14th draft pick in the 2011 NBA Draft.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Given the depth of the current Rockets squad, it is easy to spot that glaring hole they have at the power forward slot. Hence, I’ll take <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/6459" target="_blank"><b>Nikola Mirotić</b></a> on behalf of Daryl Morey and the Houston Rockets. Nikola should be an analytical puzzle for Morey’s stats men to figure out early on, but with James Harden operating things, it will create many open looks for Mirotić, who (ironically) thrives on <a href="http://stats.nba.com/league/player/shots/#!/?Season=2015-16&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&TeamID=1610612741&sort=EFG_PCT&dir=1&ShotDistRange=&CloseDefDistRange=2-4%20Feet%20-%20Tight" target="_blank">decently defended shots</a> and checks in <a href="http://stats.nba.com/playtype/#!/post-up/?dir=-1&OD=defensive&Season=2015-16&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&sort=Percentile&CF=TeamNameAbbreviation*E*chi" target="_blank">near the first percentile</a> as a post-up defender.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Oh, this pick isn’t looking too good anymore...but too late! We’re on to Indiana. Matt, who are you picking?</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Matt:</b> How can a player thrive on closely defended shots? That baffles me, but I guess anything is possible for someone who may have come straight out of the movie <a href="http://i.imgur.com/yEtX0mM.png" target="_blank"><em>300</em></a>. Anyways, on to the next pick. The Indiana Pacers are one of those teams I just can’t really figure out. They have plenty of talent in Paul George, Monta “Mississippi Missile” Ellis, George Hill, and talented rookie Myles Turner has impressed. But they’re still only a slightly above-average team in the Eastern Conference (32-29 record, seventh seed). However, they look poised to break out at any point, and the player I’m selecting for the Pacers could really aid them in doing so.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">I’m picking one of my favorite players in this draft, <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/6447" target="_blank"><b>Enes Kanter</b></a>, center from the University of Kentucky (shocking I know, <a href="http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/news/story?id=6000134" target="_blank">another Kentucky player</a>), for the Pacers. Kanter is an absolute monster on the glass, seventh in rebounding rate in the NBA, and an extremely good post-up player on offense. He can change games with his offensive ability, and create second chance after second chance with his prowess on the offensive boards. However, Kanter has one glaring weakness: <a href="https://vine.co/v/O2dI0EQn2LX" target="_blank">his lack of any noticeable defensive ability</a>. Teams pick on him constantly, attacking him both in drives to the rim and with pick-and-rolls. If Kanter were even a below-average defender rather than <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/page/2/sort/DRPM/position/9" target="_blank">the absolute worst in the NBA</a> (yes, you read that right, Kanter has the worst defensive rating of any current NBA center) he would be the type of player that any franchise would be dying to get their hands on. Despite his remarkable lack of defense, he is still a valuable piece that any team would be lucky to have. And during those first few Pacers years, he would be Roy Hibbert’s understudy, so that when Roy inevitably dashes for LA, the Pacers just have to plug in Kanter before continuing to chug along. The Pacers have the personnel to make up for Kanter’s lack of defense, and he could provide the offensive spark necessary to take the Pacers to the next level.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">So, we have officially reached the halfway point of our 2011 NBA Re-Draft, thanks for sticking with us. This is where the quality of players begins to suffer, but there are still a few (rough) gems left on the board; two of which are, arguably, the Morris twins. Viraj, are you gonna be the one to finally take the plunge and select one of them?</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Viraj:</b> Yes, we tip our hats to those handful of rabid NBA diehards that managed to make it this far out. Here’s how we stand at the halfway mark. The great news is there’s still lots of talent remaining in the draft pool.</p></div>
				
				<img src="mar-nba-article-images/re-draft-halfway.png" class="each_epl_image">
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Let’s keep going, shall we? With the 16th pick of the 2011 NBA Re-Draft, on behalf of the Philadelphia 76ers, I will select <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/6462" target="_blank"><b>Mar</b>...<em>wait for it</em>...<em>are you ready?</em>...<b>cus Morris</b></a>!</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">I did it. Whew. There’s NO way head coach Doug Collins (who ushered in Michael Jordan’s first few Bulls years) and the 2010-11 Philadelphia 76ers, who went 41-41 in the season leading up to the 2011 Draft, mess this pick up, right?</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">(Just kidding, just kidding. I couldn’t resist.)</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Yes, even in this Re-Draft, the 76ers will find a way to derail the career of Marcus Morris. That is if the young fella doesn’t find a way to botch it up first. Matt, can you imagine how the Philly media would rip apart Marcus if they found out the level of crazy he operates at from day-to-day? They ripped apart Terrell Owens for doing sit-ups in his driveway, what would they say if they saw a 2016 Marcus Morris?</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Matt:</b> I’m pretty sure the Sixers would boo this pick, but that’s no surprise for the fans that <a href="http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/sports/Philly-fan-mishaps-92790554.html" target="_blank">throw batteries at opposing players</a> and boo Santa. Either way you made the right pick, and the 76ers fans should be happy with what they are getting here. Marcus is a talented player, who, if reigned in properly (and the Pistons have provided the blueprint this season on how to do so), can be a valuable asset to any team.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Viraj:</b> And remember, Marcus would be joining a Philly team that would soon go out and fetch Andrew Bynum and his paper-thin knees. Oh, and you put Bynum, Marcus (who’ll pester the Sixers’ management non-stop to trade for Markieff until Philly completes the set), AND Jahlil Okafor’s just-as-crazy self onto this team? Man, I don’t even want to think about this anymore. Let’s just move onto your 17th pick while we’re ahead…</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Matt:</b> Sounds good to me, the least time we have to spend on the dumpster fire that are the 76ers, the better. However, they are without a doubt entertaining.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Now we move to the New York Knicks for the 18th pick. As much as I love to watch Robin “Sideshow Bob” Lopez posterize opposing centers while also managing to harass team mascots, he just isn’t the big man the Knicks will need if they are ever going to be a top tier team. This honor falls to the Lithuanian brute, <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/6477" target="_blank"><b>Jonas Valančiūnas</b></a>.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Still only 23 years old, “Big Science” (thanks, Drake) came straight from Lithuania to the pros and immediately proved that he was the real deal. An extremely talented low-post player, Jonas can decimate interior defenses with his efficient inside game. He has a solid midrange shot, shooting about 45% from 10-14 feet the past two seasons. If he works on this shot, he could add another piece to his already dynamic offensive game and keep defenses honest outside of the paint with a possibility of the pick-and-pop.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Often getting lost on pick and rolls, Valanciunas is no more than a below-average defender which does hurt his value. But this is a part of his game he has worked on, improving enough that he offers a positive defensive +/- so far this season. If the Knicks can take some defensive responsibility away from Valančiūnas, the big Lithuanian would be a large improvement down low.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Viraj:</b> Wait, so with you taking Jonas V. off of my hands, it paves the way for me to draft <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/6461" target="_blank"><b>Markieff Morris</b></a> for the Washington Wizards.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><a href="http://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2016/2/18/11054486/markieff-morris-suns-hoverboard" target="_blank">You’re welcome</a>, Washington!</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But actually, on paper, Markieff fits really well with a 2015-16 Wizards squad that also has Klay Thompson on its roster (thanks to our Re-Draft). A starting five featuring John Wall, Bradley Beal, Klay Thompson, Markieff Morris, and Marcin Gortat can definitely contend for a title or two. The great news is that the Wizards were also thinking on my wavelengths, because they went out and acquired Markieff at the trade deadline!</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">I love it when our Re-Draft picks end up on the actual, current NBA rosters. Matt, do you think Randy Wittman will go <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/14596734/carolina-panthers-coach-ron-rivera-bans-hoverboards-bank-america-stadium" target="_blank">the Ron Rivera route</a> and ban all hoverboards from the Wizards stadium? And how upset will that make Markieff, on a scale of one to ten (one = sad; ten = upset enough to cause bodily harm to Wittman)?</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Matt:</b> One phrase I would never use to describe Markieff is “level-headed”, so if hoverboards do end up banned from the Verizon center he could have a worse reaction than… Well, every time <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS6pGNovW0c" target="_blank">a call goes against either him or his team</a>.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Back to the Hornets! After picking Kemba Walker with their pick earlier in the draft, M.J.’s Hornets picked <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/6427" target="_blank"><b>Bismack Biyombo</b></a> with the 19th pick. And guess what? Jordan got both draft picks right. No really, I’m as amazed as you are, but it’s true. Bismack Biyombo, a center hailing from the Democratic Republic of Congo, is exactly what the Hornets need right now. So everything’s great, right? Unfortunately, no. The Charlotte Hornets decided not to offer “Biz” a new contract during this past offseason, and he was quickly snatched up by the Raptors. For a team that struggles on the defensive side of the ball, especially after losing Michael Kidd-Gilchrist for the remainder of the season, Biyombo’s phenomenal defense, both in the low-post and, surprisingly, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyI2jhPVhms" target="_blank">in transition</a>, would be a welcome addition to the current Hornets roster. Though not an extremely talented offensive player, Bismack’s defense more than makes up for any shortcomings in this area; which is how he has carved out a valuable role on a talented Raptors team, averaging 22 minutes per game so far this season.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Viraj:</b> With the 20th pick, I’m going to select <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/6480" target="_blank"><b>Derrick Williams</b></a> for the Minnesota Timberwolves. Hey, lay off of me, T-Wolves fans! This pick can’t be much worse than what David Kahn would’ve cooked up, right?</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Williams was unjustifiably taken way too high (second overall) in the actual 2011 NBA Draft by the T-Wolves, but at number 20, he seems a more qualified candidate, especially given his decent production with the Knicks this season. While he hasn't come close to his best Minnesota season (2013-14: 12.0 PTS, 5.5 REB, 0.6 AST) again, his Knicks season this year has been fruitful (8.7 PTS, 3.5 REB, 0.8 AST). Williams is a career 29% 3-pt shooter, and for a guy that’s 6’8” and is trying to exist in a league that’s continually going small-ball, not having a reliable 3-pt shot is a death sentence. But, in those 2011-2013 T-Wolves teams, he did get many opportunities to prove his worth, and if the same experience is unfolded again - without the expectations of being a super-high pick - I have a feeling that D-Will would impress us all. Sometimes, being the second overall pick can really hurt a player’s development due to the sheer amount of expectations put on him, and in D-Will’s case, being Re-Drafted 20th would be exactly what he would have needed in order to show us his full potential.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Matt:</b> I think he’s a steal with the 20th pick, he still has so much potential. And have you seen some of his dunks? I’d take him 20th just to see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6UOs6CsqCQ" target="_blank">a few more like this</a>!</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">So, we’ve gone through 20 picks and neither of us has picked <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/6440" target="_blank"><b>Tobias Harris</b></a>? I’ll take that late first-round value for the Portland Trail Blazers!</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The forward from the University of Tennessee has embodied the “good numbers/bad team” conundrum so often faced by NBA front offices, <a href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/the-good-the-bad-and-the-tobias/" target="_blank">as described by Zach Lowe</a> of Grantland last year. Harris has averaged about 16 points and seven rebounds while playing meaningful minutes over the last three seasons for the Orlando Magic, while being continually undervalued around the league (the Magic traded him to the Pistons for Ersan Ilyasova and Brandon Jennings earlier this month). His critics often cite <a href="http://i0.wp.com/espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/th-91.gif?strip=all" target="_blank">poor decision-making</a>, including jacking up contested threes rather than making the extra pass, as his fatal flaw. And while his poor decision making can hurt his team, that can be learned in time. Despite playing multiple years in the NBA he is still a relatively raw talent; a perfect fit for the Blazers, who can take the time to sculpt him into the All-Star caliber player he is capable of being.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">So Viraj, think you can <em>strike gold</em> with the Nuggets’ first round pick? Get it? I know, I know. I’m so clever.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Viraj:</b> I’ll one up you with the lame jokes. Did you know when I first began following the NBA on a consistent basis back in the 2003-04 season, I thought the “Nuggets” bit in Denver’s team name referred to chicken nuggets? Which raised even more questions than it answered, like “Why is a professional basketball team based in Denver named after chicken nuggets?!?” And if we’re picking a food-based team name, then why be happy with the sub-standard “Nuggets”? Why not go with the “Denver Lasangas” or the “Denver <a href="http://www.bustle.com/articles/22676-11-foods-with-unbelievably-weird-names-because-foodies-have-an-odd-sense-of-humor" target="_blank">Priest Stranglers</a>,” instead?</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Anyways, back to the Re-Draft.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">On behalf of the Denver Nuggets, I will select <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/6464" target="_blank"><b>Donatas Motiejūnas</b></a> with the 22nd pick. Donatas is a strong contender for the “Best First Name” award in this Re-Draft. But he has also had a decent NBA career. After two not-too-impressive years in the league, Donatas was sick of riding the bench and walked right up to Kevin McHale and told him, “I’m the captain now.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="video_container"><iframe class="youtube_video" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/OCpUjERoMKI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">At which point, McHale decided it would be in everyone’s best interest to board the Donatas Roller Coaster. Hence, in the 2014-15 season, we saw Donatas have the best season of his career as he posted a splendid 12.0 PTS, 5.9 REB, and a 50% field goal percentage while starting in 62 of his 72 games. Of course, this season, Kevin “Captain Phillips” McHale was unceremoniously fired after the Rockets sputtered to a 4-7 start, which meant Donatas began riding the pine once more (can Houston’s season get any more frustrating?!?).</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In the end, Donatas made sense for Houston, and, on paper, he would make sense for George Karl’s Nuggets in the 2011-12 season and beyond. I can see him having a couple of All-Star appearances in those Nuggets colors. Too bad he’s being set up to fail in Houston’s red and white.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Matt:</b> Speaking of Houston, if you watch the NBA in any capacity you likely know that the Houston Rockets are terrible at defense, even when they decide to actually try. Here are three stats showing just how bad they truly are: The Rockets are <a href="https://www.teamrankings.com/nba/stat/defensive-efficiency" target="_blank">bottom five</a> in defensive efficiency, <a href="http://stats.nba.com/league/team/#!/opponent/?sort=OPP_PTS&dir=1" target="_blank">third-worst</a> in points/game allowed, and <a href="http://stats.nba.com/league/team/defense/#!/?sort=D_FGM&dir=1" target="_blank">allowing the third-highest make-percentage</a> on contested shots.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">I say all of this to illustrate that the continually underperforming Rockets have one glaring need: defense. <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/6468" target="_blank"><b>Iman Shumpert</b></a>, guard from Georgia Tech, is the player to help fill this void. Known largely for his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtgOpBn_d1w" target="_blank">stifling defense</a> and quick hands, he is exactly the type of player the Rockets need. While their current roster sacrifices defense in the name of scoring, Shumpert could bring a sense of balance to the Rockets. A capable ball handler and shooter, Shumpert can limit opposition scoring without significantly hurting their offense, and would be the perfect complement to James <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsK7vv1fjnc" target="_blank">“I sporadically play defense”</a> Harden.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In my opinion, the Thunder, led by the dynamic duo of Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant, are the third best team in the NBA and arguably one piece away from contending with the Warriors and Spurs. So, Viraj, can you pick out the Thunder’s missing piece from the remaining players in this draft?</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Viraj:</b> This is one of those rare instances where the team drafted a better player in the actual 2011 Draft (Reggie Jackson, who is now excelling on the Pistons) than any I could select from the remaining options we have. But the guy that caught my eye is MarShon Brooks, who currently plays for the Chinese Basketball Association’s Jiangsu Dragons. And he’s tearing it up for them! Just consider his breathtaking 35.0 points per game, 2.3 STL, and 4.2 AST stat line! With stats like those, he’s on pace to get his own museum in China, <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/14421623/stephon-marbury-getting-own-museum-beijing" target="_blank">just like the one Stephon Marbury was gifted</a> a few months back.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Anyways, all of that is to say that I’m taking <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/6428/marshon-brooks" target="_blank"><b>MarShon Brooks</b></a> on behalf of the Thunder. No, really. I swear I’m not trying to <a href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/you-realize-how-badly-the-t-wolves-screwed-up-the-2009-draft-right/" target="_blank">pull a David Kahn</a> here!</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Matt:</b> Hold on… MarShon Brooks? Would this happen to be the same MarShon Brooks that frustrated the living daylights out of former Nets coach Avery Johnson?</p></div>
				
				<div class="video_container"><iframe class="youtube_video" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xP6S-SMLZ1c?start=229" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">MAH-SAHN!! MAH-SHAN, that’s NOT how we guard BAHN-YANI!! THAT’S NOT BAHN-YANI, MAH-SAHN!</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Oh, I love Avery Johnson, too bad the Nets didn’t give him more chances...</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">I do see the potential fit in OKC for MarShon, though, because there’s no doubt he’s a quality scorer (averaging over 35 points/game in China, as you said) and he could potentially play the Dion Waiters role (sit in the corner and wait until someone passes him the ball, then shoot no matter how tightly defended he is) at a higher level than Waiters currently does. Maybe he’s the third scoring option the Thunder need, who am I to doubt?</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Either way, let’s move on to the 25th pick of the draft. I am selecting <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/6431" target="_blank"><b>Norris Cole</b></a>, point guard out of Cleveland State University (who knew?), for the Boston Celtics. This is by no means a sexy pick, as Norris Cole is not an overly exciting player, but he would make a great backup for the Boston Celtics. Since Isaiah Thomas was drafted earlier in this Re-Draft by the Cavaliers, he is not currently on the Celtics, leaving them lacking in depth at point guard. Marcus Smart is, in my opinion, a star in the making and more than capable of manning the point for the Celtics, but a solid backup is always a welcome addition. Cole’s combination of tough defense, quality court vision, and a never-ending motor would be a welcome addition to Brad Stevens’ Celtics squad.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Viraj:</b> Matt, while I love the Norris Cole-to-Boston pick, has there been an athlete that has lost more than Norris Cole in this alternate Re-Draft universe? Instead of being referred to as “two-time NBA champion Norris Cole” for the rest of his life, Norris would whittle away season after season in the freezing New England area, while missing the boat on the 2008 Celtics team that won the title. So, poor Norris would be robbed of his two Miami titles and be three years too late to win one with Boston!</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">With the 26th pick, I will select <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/3593" target="_blank"><b>Bojan Bogdanović</b></a> for the Dallas Mavericks. I don’t know if the Mavs still splurge on Chandler Parsons (given that the Kings still develop him properly in the fictional seasons following this Re-Draft) if Bojan is on their team right from the get-go. Bojan is averaging 9.4 PTS, 1.0 APG, and 2.9 REB in his career, which would be considered solid production from any late-first round pick. He doesn’t shoot as well from 3-pt. land as we would like, but the 2011-12 Mavs would have afforded Bojan plenty of open looks. Remember, those 2011-12 Mavs had Brian Cardinal, Shawn Marion, and Lamar Odom as their small forwards. Given Marion’s blossoming age, Lamar’s off-the-court issues, and Brian’s irrelevance, Bojan would’ve definitely helped out in Dallas.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Matt:</b> Much like my last pick, this will be far from exciting. Instead it addresses a need the Brooklyn Nets currently have, which is about all you can ask for at this stage of the draft. With the 27th pick of the 2011 draft, I am selecting <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/6446" target="_blank"><b>Cory Joseph</b></a>, point guard from the University of Texas, for the Brooklyn Nets. The Nets are very thin at point guard, especially after losing Jarrett Jack for the season with a torn ACL. Running a combination of Donald Sloan and Shane Larkin at point guard just isn’t going to cut it in the NBA, and Joseph could help salvage the situation. Cory Joseph will likely never operate as a true starting point guard in the NBA, but his ability to take care of the ball (averaging less than 1 turnover/game for his career), <a href="http://www.poundingtherock.com/2014/11/16/7231899/cory-joseph-spurs-assessment" target="_blank">attempt quality shots</a> off the dribble, and his efforts on defense make him an ideal backup point guard. Some consistency at point guard is exactly what the Nets need, and Cory Joseph fits the bill.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Viraj:</b> I’ll continue the point guard trend and select <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/6434/jimmer-fredette" target="_blank"><b>Jimmer Fredette</b></a> on behalf of the Chicago Bulls. No, I’m not being cruel, Bulls fans. If the Knicks fans are chanting “WE WANT JIMMER! WE WANT JIMMER!” every two seconds during a home game, how bad can Jimmer really be? Then again, the Chicago fans <em>would</em> know Jimmer’s game fairly well, since Jimmer’s stint on the 2013-14 Bulls only lasted eight games.</p></div>
				
				<a href="https://twitter.com/TimBontemps/status/704857736291479552" target="_blank"><img src="mar-nba-article-images/bontemps-tweet.png" class="each_epl_image"></a>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Jimmer’s pretty much the Tim Tebow of basketball. He was the big man on campus at BYU (Tebow was similarly deified at Florida). Then he was drafted super-high - to everyone’s surprise - by the Milwaukee Bucks, who used 10th pick of the first round on him. Similarly, Tebow was drafted in the first round by the Denver Broncos. Both had fairly reasonable first two years in their respective leagues. And both were shipped off to another team after their second year (for Jimmer, it was mid-way through his third year, but same difference). And now, both are on the outskirts of the limelights of the NBA and NFL. And it doesn’t look to be changing anytime soon for this star-aligned, dynamic college superstars.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But who knows what would have happened with Jimmer had the Bulls taken him 28th (given he was available at the time)? Would his career have fared better with a coach like Tom Thibodeau guiding him? Would his game have benefitted from witnessing an athletic freak like Derrick Rose was at the time? We really don’t know the answers to those questions, but Jimmer would’ve done well for Chicago. I think.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Matt:</b> Wow. You got so carried away by Jimmer Mania that you forgot all about the guy I’m about to select right now with the 29th (and my last) pick in the draft. And this is one of my favorite picks, based on both the player’s talent and the potential fit I see with the Spurs. I am selecting <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/6454" target="_blank"><b>Shelvin Mack</b></a>, point guard from Butler University, for the San Antonio Spurs. Some of you may remember Mack from Butler’s unbelievable NCAA tournament game, where they were just inches away from taking down Duke in the 2010 National Championship game.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Since then Mack has bounced around the NBA, struggling to find the right fit. However, if presented with the right opportunity he has the potential to make a big impact. After recently being traded to the Utah Jazz, he has already taken over the starting job and has <a href="https://twitter.com/utahjazz/status/701607956110901248" target="_blank">made an immediate impact</a>. Much like the Jazz, the Spurs rely on good decision making, great defense, and smart passing to be successful. These are all qualities the former Butler Bulldog possesses, and could fit nicely in Popovich’s system. His college basketball success indicates he is a very coachable player, willing to thoroughly learn the system. Players like this thrive on the Spurs, and I believe Mack could be an important part of their backcourt.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Viraj:</b> Matt, what a great pickup by you on behalf of the Spurs. Leave to the Spurs organization to take a diamond in the rough like Shelvin Mack and turn him into the next Tony Parker, which is exactly what they would’ve done had Mack ended up in Alamo City.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">With the 30th and final pick of this 2011 NBA Re-Draft, I select <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/6452" target="_blank"><b>Jon Leuer</b></a>, a 6’10” power forward out of Bo Ryan’s Wisconsin program. In real life, Leuer was drafted by the Milwaukee Bucks in the second round. Then he rode the bench for most of his career until this 2015-16 season when he landed in Phoenix’s bumbling hands. And he’s put up numbers (8.7 PTS, 5.4 RPG, and a 47.6% FG%) for the Suns this season!</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Of course, the Bulls took Jimmy Butler with the 30th pick in the actual 2011 NBA Draft and we took Jimmy B. with the number one overall pick in this Re-Draft. So, before we have the Bulls fans come after both of us with pitchforks for single-handedly ruining their franchise via this fictional Draft, let’s end the Re-Draft.</p></div>
