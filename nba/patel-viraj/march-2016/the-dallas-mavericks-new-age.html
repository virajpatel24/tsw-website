				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Dallas Mavericks head coach Rick Carlisle demands that all of his players hoop by one guiding principle: <em><a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/53671/the-book-on-rick-carlisle" target="_blank">Find the right shot at the right time for the right guy</a></em>. It’s almost a lifestyle choice for Carlisle’s players by this point. Those individuals looking for the “left shot at the left time for the left guy” are weeded out, as Rajon Rondo found out the hard way last season.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">As the 30-year-old Rondo departed for Sacramento in the offseason, the Mavericks began pursuing a 27-year-old center named DeAndre Jordan, who was also plying his trade for a California-based club at the time. In the end, DeAndre pulled a switcheroo when he verbally committed to a four-year, $80 million deal with the Mavs and then proceeded to renege on the offer over the next few days, thanks to his Clippers teammates and <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2015/7/8/8914659/the-clippers-mavericks-battle-for-deandre-jordan-is-all-out-emoji" target="_blank">some well-crafted emojis</a>.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">While Dallas fans justifiably stewed in DeAndre-gate, the Mavs quietly went out and snagged Wesley Matthews from Portland on a four-year contract, while acquiring veteran center Zaza Pachulia from Milwaukee. The point guard position was addressed next. With Rondo out, the Mavs signed Deron Williams to a two-year contract and re-signed J.J. “Heat Killer” Barea to a four-year deal. The summer was capped off with the signings of forward Charlie Villanueva and center JaVale “Always Shaqtin’ A Fool” McGee.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">With both Parsons and Matthews coming off of major offseason surgeries, the Mavs were expected to struggle out of the gate. Dirk and Deron were rapidly-aging veterans who were already displaying diminishing returns. And while Rick Carlisle’s job remained safe, Mark Cuban’s limits were set to be tested as a seemingly tumultuous 2015-16 season beckoned. In fact, most NBA columnists had the Mavs’ internal engine combusting from the start.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Grantland’s Zach Lowe remarked in his <a href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/35-crazy-predictions-for-the-2015-16-nba-season/" target="_blank">season-opening preview</a> piece, “The Mavs owe a top-seven-protected first-rounder to Boston, and if things go badly enough early, you could see them spiraling toward one of the league’s seven worst records. Shut down the recovering wings, clean up one of Dirk’s joints, and stink all spring.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Sports Illustrated’s Will Laws <a href="http://www.si.com/nba/2015/07/16/nba-standings-predictions-hornets-thunder-celtics-blazers-mavericks" target="_blank">predicted a 41-41 record in Dallas</a> and added that we will witness Dallas “struggling to even make the postseason at all.” Five out of seven of <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/2015/10/26/9582350/nba-predictions-2015-championship-golden-state-warriors" target="_blank">SB Nation’s basketball writers</a> predicted that the Mavs would set up a nice nest in the Western Conference’s fifteenth spot. Bleacher Report’s Josh Martin put the final nail in the coffin by forecasting a measly <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2574047-nba-predictions-2015-16-win-loss-projections-for-every-team/page/8" target="_blank">32-50 record</a> for Big D.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">If we fast-forward to today, we would find that the Mavs have rolled to a 34-34 record, and have a grasp on the West’s final playoffs spot. The Mavs’ success is, in part, due to the in-built parity of the West this season. Most teams have served as the proverbial backscratchers to the championship-level itches of San Antonio (57-10) and Golden State (61-6). Hence, the losing has been distributed fairly equally to the West’s other top teams.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">So, the question that is begging to be asked is the following: Despite the total disregard for their talents in the preseason, why has Dallas surpassed those expectations by a mile? In layman’s terms, why hasn’t Dallas fallen off the face of the map just like Meek Mill did after Drake’s rap lyrics eviscerated him?</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In fact, most of the elite stats claim that Dallas has sunk this season when compared to last season. The team put up 105 points per game last season. This year, they’ve dropped to 102. Their defense has improved a bit, but it’s only slightly above average. For instance, in the 2013-14 season, Dallas had a 46.4% defensive field goal percentage (the higher that percentage, the worse the defense), which was 23rd-best in the NBA. In 2014-15, the club improved to 17th-best while sporting a 45% defensive FG%. And this season, they’ve stayed the same (45% defensive FG%) while moving up a spot to 16th-best.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Basically, how has Rick Carlisle taken Dallas to a .500 record this deep into the season when his team scores less and defends at the average level?</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Offensively, Carlisle’s “find the best possible shot” philosophy is espoused in Dallas’s free-flowing ball movement on the hardwood: The Mavs <a href="http://stats.nba.com/tracking/#!/team/passing/?sort=PASSES_MADE&dir=1" target="_blank">make 338.4 passes</a> per game, an amount that’s third-most in the league right now behind the Jazz and, surprisingly, Knicks. The league’s two best teams – Spurs and Warriors – follow Dallas in the fourth and fifth spots, so Dallas’s offense gains some credence. However, despite that collection of passes each night, Dallas checks in at only 15th-best when it comes to the <a href="http://stats.nba.com/tracking/#!/team/passing/?sort=AST&dir=1" target="_blank">team assists</a> leaderboards - the Warriors dish out 29.2 assists per game while Dallas only ekes out 22.2.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But hey, since the Mavs don’t have a superstar-studded roster the way the Spurs, Warriors, and Cavs do, it makes sense that the basketball has to travel a few more times before finding the best possible shot, which generally leads to easy spot-up 3s for D-Will or Dirk or Parsons.</p></div>
				
				<div class="video_container"><iframe class="youtube_video" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/VXfn9Tpz6m8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Defensively, the team lost a defensive anchor in Tyson Chandler in the offseason to the Suns. However, Chandler’s <a href="http://stats.nba.com/tracking/#!/player/defense/?CF=TEAM_ABBREVIATION*E*DAL&Season=2014-15&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&sort=DEF_RIM_FGA&dir=1" target="_blank">50.8% rim protection percentage</a> from the 2014-15 season has been almost seamlessly replaced by Zaza Pachulia’s <a href="http://stats.nba.com/tracking/#!/player/defense/?CF=TEAM_ABBREVIATION*E*DAL&Season=2015-16&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&sort=DEF_RIM_FGA&dir=1" target="_blank">52.9%</a>, at less than half the financial cost. Big men Salah Mejri (45.3% rim protection percentage, which is the best among the team’s big men), David Lee (49.4%), and Dwight Powell (49.5%) have significantly helped the team overcome Chandler’s defensive void. And between those three, Tyson Chandler’s 1.2 blocks from last season are easily surpassed by the aggregated 1.7 from the Lee-Mejri-Powell triumvirate.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">On the offensive end, the ageless wonder Dirk Nowitzki leads the squadron with 18.3 points per game. Williams, Parsons, and Matthews are the next options on Dallas’s scoring sheets. But Dallas’s depth shows up to bite unsuspecting teams at key times. For top-heavy teams, like Golden State, opposing teams know that once the three-headed monster of Curry, Thompson, and Draymond leaves the court, the bench’s production will pale in comparison to that of their three leaders. But when Dallas’s core four of Dirk, Matthews, Parsons, and Williams depart the court, opposing teams have to contend with J.J. Barea (9.7 PPG), Zaza (9.3), Raymond Felton (9.2), David Lee (8.3), and Devin Harris (7.1). That’s a whopping 43.6 points from your non-stars!</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Dallas is also <a href="http://stats.nba.com/league/team/#!/?sort=FG3A&dir=1" target="_blank">among the league leaders in 3s attempted per game</a> at 28.1. And they sink in 9.6 of those. Though the Mavs remain in the bottom-third of the league in terms of free throws attempted, they <a href="http://stats.nba.com/league/team/#!/?sort=FT_PCT&dir=1" target="_blank">convert on them</a> far more efficiently (79.3%). The free throws become important since Dallas doesn’t receive many second-chance opportunities – they check in at <a href="http://stats.nba.com/league/team/#!/?sort=OREB&dir=-1" target="_blank">28th-best</a> in offensive rebounds per game (8.9). Carlisle, in realizing the paucity of scoring chances for the Mavs, makes it a team mandate to commit the least turnovers in the NBA (the Mavs have made this a reality by <a href="http://stats.nba.com/league/team/#!/?sort=TOV&dir=-1" target="_blank">giving up the ball only 12.8 times</a> every game).</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">After the triumphant championship season in 2010-11, Mark Cuban began placing austerity measures on the Mavs, which spelled the start of constant roster turnovers in the offseason, which have continued to this day. As Chandler departed for the Knicks in the summer of 2011, he took with him the Mavs’s aspirations of repeating their title run. With LeBron James’s Miami teams growing stronger in the subsequent years and the Western Conference reigning supreme, Cuban’s tightening of Dallas’s fortunes came at an unfortunate time. By the time Chandler had returned to the Big D in 2014-15, both he and the team found their championship window nailed shut.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">And through that maelstrom of roster changes and free agent signings and season-ending injuries, Rick Carlisle has managed to extract more out of his roster than almost any other NBA coach, the exception being Gregg Popovich. Carlisle has taken criticism this season for preferring his tried-and-tested veterans instead of the largely unpredictable rookies the Mavs have in their stable. The over-reliance on J.J. Barea, a diminutive point guard with the scoring touch, five years after his game-changing 2011 NBA Finals performances <a href="http://www.mavsmoneyball.com/2016/1/10/10745682/criticism-and-praise-for-rick-carlisles-mavericks-rotations" target="_blank">has also been scrutinized</a>.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Zaza Pachulia’s offensive rebounding skills are admirable, but he is prone to fall behind on the simplest of pick-and-rolls. At times, Carlisle’s biggest issues erupt at the point guard position where he has to pick the worst of three evils during crunch time: Should he play a stable Deron Williams, insert a penetrator like Barea, or stay with Devin Harris for the defense?</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">All of those decisions were forced upon him last night in Cleveland as the Mavs struggled to outpace the Cavs. And all three guys fared well – Barea scored at will, Harris defended, and D-Will distributed – and towards the end of the game, Carlisle was forced to go with the Barea/Harris combo that ultimately lost the Mavs the game with their untimely turnovers.</p></div>
				
				<div class="video_container"><iframe class="youtube_video" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/rOBKp5yzD5I" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">On another night, that same combo will overproduce. But against the Cavs, the Mavs tried the small ball strategy throughout virtually the whole game and it backfired since Cleveland’s offense scrapped together more points in the end. Carlisle hasn’t played small ball often this season, but against Cleveland he tried it. It didn’t work last night. But it may bear fruits should the Mavs make it to the postseason.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">That’s the great thing about this Mavs team. For instance, in Charlotte a couple nights ago, Carlisle opted for Raymond Felton in the starting lineup and it paid off as Felton went on to dish out 12 assists. Deron, Dirk, and Parsons came through in the fourth, too, as they warded off a late-game surge from the Hornets. And Wesley Matthews rounded off the night with some stifling defense on Charlotte’s top-scoring option, Kemba Walker.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">I’m sure the rotation-tinkering from Carlisle will continue as Dallas preps for a playoffs push. The Mavs have a few of the NBA’s toughest opponents coming up as the season winds down. Tomorrow, they will face the baby-faced assassin Stephen Curry and the Warriors at home. Then, the Blazers come into town on Sunday. From there, the Mavs will travel to Portland to face the Blazers (again) and then head down to Oakland to take on the Warriors (yet again).</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">While four-game stretches usually don’t predict the outcome of a team’s regular season, when we’re this late into the NBA campaign, it’s safe to assume that the Mavs’s postseason hopes lie completely on how they fare over the next four. The Mavericks have the genius of Rick Carlisle guiding them, they have a fiery owner in Mark Cuban, and they have the German maestro in Dirk Nowitzki. But most importantly, they have a deep bench that’s begging for minutes. And that bench may come to provide the ultimate assist.</p></div>
