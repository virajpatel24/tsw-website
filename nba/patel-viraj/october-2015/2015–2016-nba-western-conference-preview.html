				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The question on everyone’s minds heading into this past Monday afternoon was, “How can there be <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/9/30/9426469/life-on-mars-water-alien-dna-carbon-sample" target="_blank">water on Mars</a>, but absolutely none in California?” The other, equally important, question still centered around California: “How will the Cali-based Golden State Warriors perform this season after winning their first NBA championship since 1975?”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The Stephen “Wardell” Curry-led Dubs team have been in a summer-long state of euphoria after winning a hard-earned title against LeBron James’ Cleveland Cavaliers side just a few months back. But after becoming the Bay Area’s dream team, the Warriors have run into some doubts from the media about their ability to repeat as champions this season.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Harrison Barnes, usually a fourth or fifth option on the team offensively, sent shockwaves after declining the Warriors’ 4-year, $64 million contract offer last week. Stories like these have prompted the media to ask whether the team is already suffering from “<a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/golden-state-warriors/post/_/id/710/the-champion-warriors-vs-the-disease-of-more" target="_blank">the disease of more</a>,” which is a Pat Reilly-coined term referring to his theory that players, after winning a title, tend to get an inflated sense of their worth and this makes it difficult for the team to hold on to them, thus destroying the nucleus that earned the team their initial success.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But given that the new TV deal is set to kick in over the next few seasons, the increased salary cap will enable the Warriors to sign Barnes next season, despite his high demands. Additionally, the team also <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/boston/celtics/post/_/id/4720417/david-lee-ready-to-make-an-impact-in-boston" target="_blank">shipped off David Lee and his albatross of a contract to the Boston Celtics this offseason</a>, which will come in handy when Stephen Curry asks for his max-contract soon.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Having locked down Draymond Green with a <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2015/7/1/8810369/Draymond-green-contract-golden-state-warriors-nba-free-agency-2015" target="_blank">five-year, $82 million contract</a> earlier this summer and ensuring that Klay Thompson is on-board through the 2018–19 season, the Warriors won’t have to worry about retaining their core group of star players the way Oklahoma City will have to turmoil over when it comes to retaining Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>How will LaMarcus Aldridge fit into the Spurs?</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The San Antonio Spurs pulled off the blockbuster move that brought long-time Portland Trail Blazer LaMarcus Aldridge to the Alamo City in “<a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/13197710/free-agent-lamarcus-aldridge-says-sign-san-antonio-spurs" target="_blank">a four-year max contract worth more than $80 million, with an opt-out after the third year</a>,” according to ESPN’s Marc Stein. Aldridge claimed to have been physically and “<a href="http://www.expressnews.com/sports/spurs/article/Aldridge-adjusting-to-life-as-a-Spur-6446383.php?t=4f6cfb0be0927fc3fb&cmpid=twitter-premium" target="_blank">mentally drained</a>” after a spin in the free agency carousel this summer that ultimately stopped in San Antonio.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“I don’t like change,” Aldridge said. “That’s been a little bit difficult for me, trying to get used to a new city. I got lost like twice yesterday. That’s not fun.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— LaMarcus Aldridge, as quoted in Jeff McDonald’s article for the <em><a href="http://www.expressnews.com/sports/spurs/article/Aldridge-adjusting-to-life-as-a-Spur-6446383.php?t=4f6cfb0be0927fc3fb&cmpid=twitter-premium" target="_blank">San Antonio Express-News</a></em></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">If the Spurs want to embark on another championship pursuit this season, both the team and player will have to adapt on some levels. In that sense, the change-averse Aldridge will have to be open to some tough criticism from Gregg Popovich, as the coaches try to discover the best schemes and tactics that suit both the Spurs and Aldridge. According to Zach Lowe of <em>Grantland</em>, LaMarcus Aldridge can definitely elevate the Spurs, if he’s willing to cast aside some of his more selfish tendencies on the court, like settling for mid-range shots when a pass to a cutting teammate, or a post-up, or a drive to the rim would work better.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“If the Spurs fall short of expectations, it will probably be because of some other variable — age, injury, the continued decline of Tony Parker, or the brutal Western Conference landscape. It will take some sacrifice, but everyone involved is smart enough and flexible enough to make this work.”</p>
				
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Zach Lowe, <em>Grantland</em>, <a href="https://grantland.com/the-triangle/the-adjustment-bureau-how-lamarcus-aldridge-will-fit-in-with-the-spurs/" target="_blank">“The Adjustment Bureau: How LaMarcus Aldridge Will Fit in With the Spurs”</a></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>How will Portland deal with the talent drain?</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">While Aldridge packed his bags and hightailed it out of Rip City this summer, so did Robin Lopez (now on the Knicks) and Nicolas Batum (traded to the Charlotte Hornets). These successive moves completely shredded the foundation of the team and now the Blazers will have to rely upon star point guard Damian Lillard to carry the team in a tough Western Conference.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The club also exercised the team-options for three of its young talents this week in <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/blazers/index.ssf/2015/09/trail_blazers_exercise_team_options_on_cj_mccollum.html" target="_blank">Mason Plumlee, C.J. McCollum, and Noah Vonleh</a>, keeping that trio in Portland for the next two years. However, given that nearly every Western Conference team has re-loaded during this offseason, the Blazers may have already crashed out of the playoffs sweepstakes by New Year’s Eve.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>“Sink or swim” season for CP3, Blake, and DeAndre?</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The Los Angeles Clippers have not historically been a great playoffs team (at least not in the past twenty years). At all. After being knocked out in the first round for two straight years during the 1991–1993 seasons, the Clips were nearly devoid of postseason play until the 2011–2012 season. They did make a brief playoffs appearance in 96–97. They also advanced past the first round in the 05–06 season before being bounced by the Steve Nash-led Phoenix Suns the next round. But, in all other seasons? Absolutely nothing.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Since the arrival of Chris Paul in 2011, the Clippers have appeared in the playoffs in each season thereafter. However, they have never advanced past the Western Conference Semi-Finals. Last season, the Clips foraged past heavy-favorites San Antonio in seven games only to go yet another seven games and lose to the Houston Rockets. Given the <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/f-minus-clippers-reportedly-deandre-jordan-article-1.2285623" target="_blank">DeAndre Jordan offseason free agency drama</a>, Chris Paul and Blake Griffin are keen to have the opportunity to collaborate with Jordan once again this season.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Speaking of Blake Griffin, the superstar has added to some tangible aspect to his burgeoning, dominant game every offseason. Already blessed with blindingly fast speed, tenacious determination, and otherworldly dunking abilities, Griffin has added a mid-range game to his skill set these past few seasons. A wider array of post-up moves and even the three-point shot have crept up in recent years. In fact, Brian Phillips of <em>Grantland</em> summed Griffin’s evolution best in his profile earlier this year:</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“And because Griffin gives off that should-be-unstoppable vibe, it’s easy to criticize him when he’s not the best player on the court. You think greatness should be his baseline, so when he’s settling for too many 12-foot jumpers, or when his post game looks like a ballet about angry hobos, you’re tempted to write him off as a one-dimensional player who never grew beyond his rookie-year reel of highlight dunks. He’s gotten a lot of that over the years.”</p>
				
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Brian Phillips, <em>Grantland</em>, <a href="https://grantland.com/the-triangle/its-a-bird-its-a-pain-the-confounding-powers-of-blake-griffin/" target="_blank">“It’s a Bird, It’s a Pain: The Confounding Powers of Blake Griffin”</a></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">It’s no doubt that for the Clippers to advance past their second-round barricade, they’ll need to be firing on all cylinders, and the contributions of their “Big Three” will prove essential when necessary. But it will be Blake Griffin’s dominance (or lack thereof) that ultimately makes the defining difference.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>What can we (reasonably) expect from the Lakers?</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Kobe Bryant’s Lakers are in a bit of a funk right now. They’ve acquiesced and handed over Hollywood bragging rights to the Clippers (something that was unthinkable before Chris Paul arrived in LA). Their aging living legend, the Black Mamba, has played sparingly (not by choice) in each of the past three seasons, suffering chronic injuries each season that have curtailed his lofty aspirations. But, despite all signs of a physical decline from Kobe, Lakers fans everywhere have more than enough reason to believe their superstar and team can figure out a way to compete in a high octane Western Conference.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“You’re not going to see Kobe jumping all over the rim like he used to do, you’re not going to see that type of athleticism. He’s still probably the smartest player in this league, he’ll still be able to get things done. But, like I said, I really got to micromanage those minutes, really watch him in practice.”</p>
				
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Byron Scott, Lakers Head Coach, as quoted by Baxter Holmes, <em>ESPN</em>, <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/losangeles/lakers/post/_/id/41817/kobe-bryant-on-youthful-lakers-i-dont-know-what-to-expect" target="_blank">“Kobe Bryant on youthful Lakers: ‘I don’t know what to expect’”</a></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The Lakers did add some young talent once again this year after snagging Ohio State’s <a href="http://www.si.com/nba/2015/06/25/dangelo-russell-2015-nba-draft-los-angeles-lakers" target="_blank">D’Angelo Russell as their first round pick</a> earlier this summer. Russell has shown the ability to excel with the pick-and-roll at OSU and should gel easily with Julius Randle. Kobe’s leadership and mentorship will also provide a decent template for both Russell and Randle to follow if they want to become the next dynamic Lakers duo a la Kobe-Shaq, in recent times, and Magic-Kareem, in decades past.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Are the Nuggets officially Danilo Gallinari’s team?</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">No NBA fan ever wakes up and has the following thought: <em>“Gee, I sure hope my team’s star player is Danilo Gallinari!”</em> But it’s the (shriveled) hand that the Denver Nuggets have been dealt. And, if Gallinari’s impact is truly studied, it gets easier to convince yourself that a Danilo-led Nuggets team could actually compete and cause some trouble in the West.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Gallinari is a versatile forward capable of playing from the two to the four and, in the latter half of last season, the Italian went bonkers by putting up offensive numbers that pleasantly surprised even the most ardent of Nuggets fans. Of course, health will be the major concern for Gallinari, who has been sidelined for decent chunks of the last five NBA seasons. The talent is there in discernible amounts, but the health? Not so much.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Check out Zach Lowe’s column from September on Gallinari’s potential impact and role on the Nuggets for deeper insights: <a href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/ciao-gallo-the-rebirth-of-danilo-gallinari-and-maybe-the-denver-nuggets/" target="_blank"><em>“Ciao, Gallo! The Rebirth of Danilo Gallinari (and Maybe the Denver Nuggets).”</em></a></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Is this Anthony Davis’s MVP season?</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Last season, the MVP race basically boiled down to Stephen Curry vs. James Harden (with Russell Westbrook being the third option for his utterly ridiculous streak of consecutive triple-doubles in the latter half of the season). But the most dominant player, arguably, was Anthony Davis of the New Orleans Pelicans.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">By the time the regular season had concluded, Davis had certainly raised some eyebrows — or, some “unibrows,” if that’s your thing — by posting a stat-line of 24.4 PPG, 10.2 RPG, and 2.9 BPG. However, the most stunning and defining metric of Davis’ fabulous season was the fact that he posted a PER (Player Efficiency Rating) of 30.89. The next closest player was Russell Westbrook at 29.12, followed by Stephen Curry (MVP) at 28.06 and James Harden at 26.76. Of course, Davis’s case for MVP was overshadowed by the fact that Curry led the Warriors to a NBA best 67–15 record while the Brow’s Pelicans just squeezed by into an eight seed with a 45–37 record.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This season, by all accounts, Davis looks primed and ready to utterly dominate the NBA. Sure, the usual suspects — Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry, and LeBron James — will certainly display their preternatural talents in full force, but Davis would be my pick for the 2015–2016 MVP when all is said and done.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Will Billy Donovan really change OKC’s fortunes?</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The NBA offseason’s biggest coaching change was the arrival of long-time University of Florida head coach Billy Donovan to Oklahoma City. In the past few seasons, the Thunder have been dominant per their usual standards, however, due to untimely injury debacles to their superstar-fueled nucleus — consisting of Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and Serge Ibaka — the OKC-based team has churned out playoffs disappointments one after another.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Just last season, the trio missed a total of 88 games, which was enough to earn them 45 wins, but <em>not</em> enough to make the playoffs as the eighth seed. With a star-studded team like Oklahoma City, barely sneaking into the playoffs is never the end-goal. And Billy Donovan’s entrance into the OKC limelight appears to be a welcome addition, judging from the fifty-year-old’s success at building great Florida teams during his tenure there.</p></div>
				
				<a href="https://twitter.com/royceyoung/status/646715378123476993" target="_blank"><img src="oct-nba-article-images/royce-young-tweet.png" class="each_epl_image"></a>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In addition to handling Kevin Durant’s return to the court after a foot injury, Donovan will have to familiarize himself with the team’s medical/training staff, his coaching assistants, understanding each player’s role on the team, watching game film from seasons past, as well as adjusting to life in Oklahoma City. It’s not a trivial task by any measure, but it shouldn’t be an impossible one for a man who’s dominated at the college level.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Deron Williams returns back home</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">When the Brooklyn Nets snapped up their star point guard Deron Williams in the summer of 2012 on a <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/news/nba--deron-williams-agrees-to--100-million-contract-with-brooklyn-nets.html" target="_blank">five-year, $100 million deal</a>, what got lost in the hubbub was the fact that Williams had also been in talks with the Dallas Mavericks that summer. The Mavs appealed to Williams since he had attended high school in Texas and had family ties in the Lone Star State. But while the Nets’ mega-deal was too enticing for Williams to refuse in 2012, the stars aligned this summer — <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2015/7/10/8930917/deron-williams-dallas-mavericks-nba-free-agency-brooklyn-nets" target="_blank">or, something like that</a> — and Williams will be able to finally don the Mavericks uniform.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Williams’ move to Dallas is very cap-friendly for the Mavs ($10 million for two years), and, if Williams rekindles his Utah Jazz form, then the Mavs will have given Dirk Nowitzki his best chance at another deep playoffs run since his last title-winning one in 2011. While Mark Cuban’s Mavericks failed to construct the <em>best</em> possible team this summer due to a certain DeAndre Jordan backing out at the last possible minute, the pieces are still in place for a veteran-led team with great coaching (Rick Carlisle is a top five coach in the NBA) to make a deep run.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The good news regarding the Houston Rockets’ 2014–2015 performance? They were second in the Western Conference after earning a 56–26 record. The bad news? That wasn’t nearly enough to prevent the Rockets from being on the receiving end of a shellacking and a sweep at the hands of the Golden State Warriors in the Western Conference Finals.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This offseason, the Kevin McHale coached team acquired the law-infringing, Kevin Hart-sized point guard named Ty Lawson from the Denver Nuggets, who were looking to ship the diminutive, but troublesome dynamo elsewhere. The Lawson deal actually makes sense for the Rockets as his speed and athleticism perfectly complements Patrick Beverley’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePtiNqJ0VPQ" target="_blank">knee-shredding</a>, defensive game.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">With Lawson disturbing opposing offenses, James Harden and Dwight Howard will both have ample room to operate.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But one thing remains a constant for the Rockets: During crunch time, we’ll all be simultaneously enthralled to wit’s end by James Harden’s creative genius <em>and</em> bored out of our minds watching Dwight Howard shoot 15% from the free throw line as teams pull the tried and tested Hack-A-Howard.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But no matter, at least this way Dwight will get to set <em>some</em> records in his NBA career!</p></div>
