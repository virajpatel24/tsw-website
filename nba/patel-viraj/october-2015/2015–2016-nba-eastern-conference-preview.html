				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">LeBron James turned some heads this offseason. Having come off of a heroic, inspired Finals performance, James, unsurprisingly, opted out of his Cavaliers contract at the start of the summer, a decision that was both expected and accepted by NBA fans. King James was looking to maximize his NBA earning potential and all the more power to him for trying that by signing “one-year deals”  as the league’s cap increases season-to-season.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But where LeBron drew gasps of complete surprise where when it came to his performance in the Amy Schumer-led and Judd Apatow-directed comedy <em>Trainwreck</em>. LeBron’s role as Bill Hader’s sidekick in the film provided some moments of extreme hilarity such as when King James interrupts a Hader-Schumer conversation by asking, “Hey, you watching <em>Downton Abbey</em> later?”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The King’s Oscar-worthy performance in <em>Trainwreck</em> have movie buffs calling for the NBA superstar’s first acting award. But for LeBron Day-Lewis, the thespian duties will have to wait for now as he and the Cleveland Cavaliers look to rekindle their NBA dreams.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The Cavs will begin their regular season against the Chicago Bulls in Chicago on October 27th and, between now and then, they have a few chinks in their armor that need to be corrected. The first chink involves Tristan Thompson. Mr. Thompson is represented by the same agents that James has and while those agents have been able to square LeBron’s contract away earlier in the summer, they haven’t been as successful with that of Thompson’s. Accordingly, Thompson is forced to hang out in this contractual “no man’s land” while the suits work out his deal.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The second chink involves the LeBron James-David Blatt relationship. On Zach Lowe’s <em><a href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/the-lowe-post-podcast-brian-windhorst-on-the-tristan-thompson-contract-situation-the-hawks-ownership-scandal-and-more/" target="_blank">The Lowe Post</a></em> podcast, ESPN’s Brian Windhorst reported on LeBron’s passive-aggressive behavior towards his head coach.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“I would love to hear David Blatt speak freely about the passive-aggressive nature that LeBron displays. There might not have been a more shocked person at Summer League when LeBron came over and hugged and sat next to David Blatt. I think it was very surprising to [Blatt]. That is [LeBron’s] character — to be that way.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Brian Windhorst, on <em><a href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/the-lowe-post-podcast-brian-windhorst-on-the-tristan-thompson-contract-situation-the-hawks-ownership-scandal-and-more/" target="_blank">The Lowe Post</a></em></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The third and final chink involves the injured and recovering players the Cavs have on their roster. Kyrie Irving, Timofey Mozgov, Kevin Love, and Anderson Varejao all suffered injuries during the previous season and Blatt and his staff have to integrate these key players into the team slowly. Given that the team has to face the Bulls in Chicago, the Grizzlies in Memphis, and the Heat in Cleveland during the first week of the season, the Cavs may roll off to a sluggish start. Time to rise and shine, David Blatt.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Can Derrick Rose stay injury-free?</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">We’re only into the preseason and Derrick Rose has already seized nationwide attention for the left orbital fracture he picked up during a team practice on Sept. 30th. The great news is that despite the serious nature of the freak injury, Rose will definitely be ready to go come opening night against the aforementioned Cleveland Cavaliers.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Teammate Pau Gasol shared his remorse for Rose’s setback, but also offered the following insight:</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“But it’s unfortunate that he won’t be able to be a part of most of training camp or the preseason because it’s a useful time for any team to get things on track, set the foundation for the season, especially with a new system, new philosophy, new coach. But no excuses. Life works out that way sometimes, and you just got to keep walking.”</p>
				
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Pau Gasol, as quoted by <a href="http://espn.go.com/chicago/nba/story/_/id/13779669/chicago-bulls-star-derrick-rose-undergoes-surgery-left-orbital-fracture" target="_blank">Nick Friedell of <em>ESPN</em></a></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The “new coach” that Gasol is alluding to in his remarks is former Iowa State head coach Fred Hoiberg, who will be shepherding the Bulls’ charge after Tom Thibodeau’s firing. Hoiberg’s offensive tactics will bring some needed positive changes to a team that is generally known for its defensive tenacity.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But for Hoiberg to cement his success in the Windy City, he will also have to try some unorthodox tactics that his predecessor was too regimented to attempt. For instance, Derrick Rose was a shell of himself (and that’s putting it nicely) when used in back-to-back games last year, as was Thibodeau’s wont. <a href="http://nyloncalculus.com/2015/07/30/derrick-rose-is-a-different-player-when-hes-rested/" target="_blank">When given a rest day or two</a>, Rose’s offensive abilities immediately skyrocketed:</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Perhaps, Hoiberg’s sweeping tactical changes will be a boon for the Bulls offense; however, it is unquestionable that his man management and his attention to players’ health could ultimately dictate how far this team will progress this upcoming season.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Will Kyle Korver shoot 50%+ from 3 pt. land?</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">At 34 years of age, Atlanta Hawks sharpshooter Kyle Korver is a seasoned NBA veteran. That’s why he took some time out of his schedule earlier this summer to help his young Hawks teammate, Dennis Schröder, <a href="http://www.albanyherald.com/news/2015/oct/10/atlanta-hawks-guard-dennis-schroder-sought/" target="_blank">with his jumpshot and release</a>. The results paid off later in the summer when Schröder joined Germany’s national team for the FIBA EuroBasket Championships. Schröder would end up with “<a href="http://www.albanyherald.com/news/2015/oct/10/atlanta-hawks-guard-dennis-schroder-sought/" target="_blank">21.0 points, 6.0 assists, 4.6 rebounds, and 4.2 turnovers in 30.4 minutes over five EuroBasket games</a>.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Korver, on the other hand, continued to work out on his own throughout the summer, as NBA vets do. But one key storyline going into this season is whether Korver can become the first NBA player to shoot 50% or better from the 3 pt. line. In the 2013–2014 season, Korver <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/k/korveky01.html" target="_blank">hit 47.2% of his 3 pointers</a>, but last season, he improved <em>two whole percentage points</em> by posting a cool 49.2% from long-range.</p></div>
				
				<img src="oct-nba-article-images/kyle-korver-shot-chart.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">SOURCE: <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/hawks/2015/02/02/kyle-korver-vs-perfection-atlanta-three-point-shot/22693565/" target="_blank">USA TODAY</a></p>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Late in the last season, Korver was still on the mark for a historic 50–50–90 season! Unfortunately, both the Hawks and their sniper cooled off as the playoffs arrived and Korver ended up with a stat-line of 48.7% (FG%), 49.2% (3P%), and 89.8% (FT%), which was just a tiny sliver away from an impressive 40–50–90 season. This upcoming campaign, Korver will look to both achieve the 40–50–90, a feat achieved by only six other NBA players in history, and the 50–50–90, if possible. But being the quintessential teammate, the most important goal for Korver will be to help his Hawks team torpedo through a weak Eastern conference.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Is there such a thing as “Cody Zeller 2.0”?</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In 2013, the Charlotte Hornets selected Indiana’s star center Cody Zeller as their fourth overall pick. Since then, Zeller’s Indiana teammate Victor Oladipo, selected second overall by the Orlando Magic, has gone on to impress us all with his high-flying, slam-dunking antics while Zeller has been relatively quiet in Buzz City.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Now unless Cody Zeller has decided to suddenly “<a href="https://twitter.com/neiltyson/status/610997574808395777" target="_blank">science the shit out of his NBA career</a>,” I don’t expect much to change. But, as always, the NBA think-tank at <em>The Charlotte Observer</em> has been quick to jump the gun and have even gone on to describe Zeller’s metamorphosis as “<a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/sports/nba/charlotte-hornets/article38751396.html" target="_blank">Cody Zeller 2.0</a>” all due to a 16 point, 10 rebound performance…wait for it…off the bench…in the pre-season.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Let’s hope Zeller 2.0’s metamorphosis avoids the whole Kafka-esque “turn-into-a-giant-insect” route.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Will the Wade-Dragić tandem hold up?</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Ethan J. Skolnick of <em>The Miami Herald</em> <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/ethan-j-skolnick/article38779071.html" target="_blank">wrote an interesting column on Oct. 11th</a> discussing the burgeoning relationship between the Heat’s Goran Dragić and Dwyane Wade. All things considered, when both stars are firing on all cylinders, there may not be a better backcourt in the East. Wade has the championship pedigree and living legend capabilities while Dragić provides the wily, sinewy cuts and silky passing.</p></div>
				
				<img src="oct-nba-article-images/wade-dragic.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a href="http://thesportsaga.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wade-dragic.jpeg" target="_blank">WWW.THESPORTSAGA.COM</a></p>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">While “D[wyane] is the opposite of Jared Dudley” in Dragić’s eyes, the Dragić-Wade combo didn’t exactly flourish when Erik Spoelstra put them both on the court at the same time. Wade actually shot much better when Dragić left the floor since he could dictate the tempo of the game more to suit his carefully attuned levels. The addition of Chris Bosh, who was sidelined for the season due to a blood clot right around the time Dragić came to the Heat last season, should help with the spacing and draw attention away from Dragić and Wade.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">However, for the Heat to truly run the table in the East this season, they will need both Dragić and Wade to flourish when left to co-exist on the court <b>and</b> when left alone to pull off their magic.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Is Milwaukee a sleeping giant?</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Well, that’s a question I never thought I’d ask when talking about the Bucks. But it’s true: In a roster stocked with young talented players like Jabari Parker, John Henson, Giannis “Greek Freak” Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton, O.J. Mayo, Greivis Vasquez, and Michael Carter-Williams, the Bucks should be able to contend in the East.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Last season, they clinched a playoffs berth with a .500 record, but the Chicago Bulls were able to defeat them in six games in the first round. This summer, Jason Kidd and the Bucks management added star big man, Greg Monroe, in free agency. And all things considered, Greek Freak probably grew about three more inches and added 130 more weapons to his game.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">On paper, it seems as if all of the pieces should fit and gel well together. Of course, the regular season will reveal Milwaukee’s strengths and weaknesses bit-by-bit, but a top four seed for the Bucks, <a href="http://www.nba.com/2015/news/09/08/nba-to-seed-conference-playoff-teams-by-record/" target="_blank">given the NBA’s realigning of the playoffs seeding this summer</a>, is a definite possibility.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Let’s build a Wall!</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been trumpeting around the idea that upon his selection as the leader of the free world in 2016, he’ll immediately embark on building a 2,000 mile long wall separating the U.S. and Mexico. Early estimates indicate that Trump’s wall will cost taxpayers “<a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/09/this-is-what-trumps-border-wall-could-cost-us.html" target="_blank">about $2.4 billion</a>.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Thankfully, Trump’s wall may come at a high cost, but the Washington Wizards, a team Trump will have court-side seats to if he’s elected president, already have a Wall of their own: John Wall, a man that’s only costing the team at <a href="http://www.si.com/nba/2015/07/15/john-wall-reggie-jackson-contracts" target="_blank">Reggie Jackson levels</a>. The supremely talented Wall, just like Reggie Jackson this summer, signed a five-year, $80 million extension in 2013.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Last season, Wall posted a stat-line of 17.6 PPG, 10.0 AST, 4.6 REB, and 1.7 STL as he clinched a second straight All-Star Game roster spot and carried the Wizards to the postseason. Wall’s running mate, Bradley Beal, was also integral to the team’s success last season. The Wall-Beal backcourt will certainly challenge the Dragić-Wade, Lowry-DeRozan, Teague-Korver, Irving-J.R. Smith, and Rose-Butler tandems for the East’s best backcourt title.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But given that the Washington Nationals shied away from the MLB postseason this year and the Capitals disappointed once again in the NHL playoffs earlier in the summer, all of Washington is desperate for the Wizards to become the D.C. team that actually lives up to its sky-high potential.</p></div>
			
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">And that’s exactly where a Wall will come in handy.</p></div>
