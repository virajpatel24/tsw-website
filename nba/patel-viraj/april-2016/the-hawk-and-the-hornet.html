				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">From 2005 to 2007, Al Horford and Marvin Williams combined to win three straight NCAA national championships. Sure, they went about it in completely differing ways, but their respective achievements remain remarkable nonetheless. Both served as the quintessential dark horses of their respective teams, quietly producing while the team’s superstars – Raymond Felton and Sean May at North Carolina and Joakim <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GianETEHqhk" target="_blank">“Frantic Dancer”</a> Noah and Corey Brewer at Florida - enjoyed the national attention. Both finished their college degrees – Horford completed his Florida education by the end of his rookie season in the NBA, and Williams, who only stayed one year at North Carolina, took <a href="http://northcarolina.247sports.com/Article/Marvin-Williams-UNC-degree-fulfilled-a-promise-33937872" target="_blank">ten years</a> to achieve that dream. And when it counted, both men showed up in college basketball’s biggest game – Williams provided eight timely points off the bench for Carolina in the 2005 title game against Illinois, and Horford averaged 16 PTS, 9.5 REB, 3.0 AST, and 2.0 BLK in his two title game appearances with Florida in 2006 and 2007.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But their defining similarity in the NBA has centered around one startling thought: Despite their collegiate glory days, neither player has been able to reach the elusive NBA Finals in their pro careers.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">And given that both will turn 30 years old this year, it’s feasible to wonder how many chances they will receive at such an ambitious goal. Over the intervening years, King James’ Cavs and Heat teams have repeatedly stunned Horford’s Atlanta Hawks in the postseason. Williams, who was Horford’s teammate for many of those stunners, hasn’t experienced much progress in this department on his other two teams (Jazz and Hornets), either.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Postseason success (or lack thereof) has always been the determining factor in the way Al Horford and Marvin Williams evaluate themselves as basketball players. When NBA.com’s Sekou Smith sat down with Horford for a candid interview in January 2014, and asked him, “Twenty years from now, when somebody says, ‘Oh, Al Horford, NBA player…,’ How do you finish that sentence, when they talk about Al Horford decades from now?”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In response, Big Al gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8a8c2ePE4dQ" target="_blank">heartfelt answer</a> to a question that he’s probably pondered over many downturns and early postseason exits.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><em>I want people to say, “Man, Al Horford. He was a winner. He went out, competed, played hard. But most importantly, he was a winner.” I want to be part of special things. I got a taste of it in college and I know how good it feels, so I want in twenty years for people to look back and say, “That guy was a winner.”</em></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This summer, he will be able to test out the free agency waters and potentially wander up north - or out west - in search of titles and glory.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Horf has been rumored to end up in Portland (Blazers GM Neil Olshey is a <a href="http://www.blazersedge.com/2016/3/16/11248312/al-horford-free-agency-rumors-portland-trail-blazers" target="_blnak">big fan</a> of Horford’s abilities) and Boston (GM Danny Ainge feels Horford is the perfect piece needed to completes the Celtics’ puzzle). The <a href="http://miamiherald.typepad.com/sports-buzz/2016/02/heats-best-lineup-options-without-bosh-heat-trade-talk-more-on-ums-potential-cb-pursuit-dolphins-mar.html" target="_blank">Miami Heat</a> and the <a href="http://www.sportingnews.com/nba-news/4695496-orlando-magic-nba-trade-deadline-florida-gators-new-cap-space-free-agency-al-horford-joakim-noah-bradley-beal" target="_blank">Orlando Magic</a> have even entered the fray, with the hopes of snagging Horford by leveraging his fond Florida memories.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">As the summer free agency period descends upon us in the near future, Marvin Gaye Williams Jr. will be a part of a substantial traveling party out of Charlotte this summer alongside Nicolas Batum, Courtney Lee, and Al Jefferson. Jeremy Lin also has the choice to opt out of his contract. Charlotte has impressed NBA fans everywhere with their late-season renaissance; the Hornets are 45-33 and sixth in the Eastern conference, but they could end the season in the third or fourth spot depending on how the Hawks, Celtics, and Heat finish their campaigns.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">An enticing free agency destination for Williams may be Detroit. By moving to the Motor City, Williams effortlessly transitions from one playoffs team to another. The coaching would also remain of the finest quality - there’s not much he would lose by leaving Steve Clifford and learning from the Notorious SVG. And for Detroit, the team would be receiving a 6’9” stretch-four who can knock down threes at the league average (35%), which takes some of the scoring pressure off of Andre Drummond.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The Williams-to-Pistons move wouldn’t have been as appealing had Detroit’s mid-season trade for Donatas Motiejūnas been successful. Donatas is a legit seven-footer with all of Williams’ capabilities, and would have been receiving starter’s minutes in Motown. However, the rescinded trade caused Houston to take back Motiejūnas and Detroit was forced to scramble for Tobias Harris, who has helped catapult the Pistons to a 14-7 record in his first few months. With Marcus Morris contributing in recent weeks and Harris off to a career-best start in his short Pistons tenure, adding Marvin Williams into the mix means there will be an odd man out.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Does Williams want to leave Charlotte, where he’s started all 77 games, just to end up in Detroit as a sixth man? It’s not like he hasn’t done this before. In his single season in Chapel Hill, Williams was an uber-effective sixth man for Roy Williams.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“At 6 feet 9 inches, Williams was supposed to be the most complete player in the tournament: he had the ability to do whatever it took for North Carolina to win. If the team needed a steal, Williams forced a turnover. If it needed a tough rebound, Williams seemed to get the rebound. If it needed a crucial basket, Williams always seemed to make the shot.</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">With ease.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— William C. Rhoden, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/29/sports/basketball/williams-makes-case-both-ways-on-age-limit.html" target="_blank">“Williams Makes Case Both Ways on Age Limit,”</a> <em>The New York Times</em></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Now in the NBA, Williams has carved out a place for himself by being the Hornets’ best <a href="http://stats.nba.com/tracking/#!/player/defense/?sort=DEF_RIM_FG_PCT&dir=-1&CF=TEAM_ABBREVIATION*E*CHA%7CGP*GE*40" target="_blank">rim protector</a>, an aware <a href="http://stats.nba.com/tracking/#!/player/passing/?CF=TEAM_ABBREVIATION*E*CHA&sort=PASSES_MADE&dir=1" target="_blank">passer</a>, a ferocious <a href="http://stats.nba.com/tracking/#!/player/rebounding/?CF=TEAM_ABBREVIATION*E*CHA&sort=REB_CHANCE_PCT&dir=1" target="_blank">rebounder</a>, and, of course, a <a href="http://stats.nba.com/tracking/#!/player/shooting/?CF=TEAM_ABBREVIATION*E*CHA%7CGP*GE*40&sort=EFF_FG_PCT&dir=1&Season=2015-16&SeasonType=Regular%20Season" target="_blank">formidable scorer</a> with the basketball. There is always going to be room for players like Marvin Williams in the NBA. And as the league continues the stretch-four revolution, it will be people like Williams and Draymond Green propelling the movement.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">For Al Horford, nailing this free agency period and landing at the best possible destination has to be his top priority. If he wants to leave this game in five to seven years with everyone regarding him as a winner, it is imperative for him to focus on weeding out the pretenders from the short list of contenders in his free agency suitors. If he returns to Atlanta, that means he places his future in the hands of a capable Mike Budenholzer; however, Atlanta has seemed to hit its ceiling in a conference that has LeBron James kinging his way to five straight NBA Finals appearances.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">And if it’s money that he desires, Atlanta is capable of offering Big Al a maximum <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/news/hawks--al-horford-expanding-his-game-as-free-agency-looms-232658396.html" target="_blank">five-year, $146 million</a> contract, according to Marc J. Spears of <em>Yahoo Sports</em>. He won’t be able to get that anywhere else on the market since Atlanta owns Horford’s bird rights.</p></div>
				
				<img src="apr-nba-article-images/horford.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a href="https://cbsatlanta.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/gettyimages-511770378.jpg?w=1500" target="_blank">WWW.ATLANTA.CBSLOCAL.COM</a></p>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The big question for Horford will center around whether he wants to leave the east coast and head west. If he does choose to migrate to a different time zone, the best fit will be in Portland. With the NBA’s cap set to increase to roughly $90 million this summer, teams like Portland will have enough to offer a max deal to Horford and a mini-max to a supporting player.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">If Horf does end up in Portland, the intriguing aspect would be if Portland go out and add a fourth piece to that newly-formed Lillard-McCollum-Horford triumvirate. In the likely scenario that this does occur, the best fourth option for Portland is to find a clever way to convince Harrison Barnes to spurn Golden State and stake his claim in a town like Portland.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Barnes is a player who has been the fourth scoring option on his Warriors team ever since his arrival to the NBA. By leaving the Dubs and heading up north to Portland, he would become a key cog in Terry Stotts’ revitalized Portland side. And his 6’8” frame would help shore up Portland’s defensive lapses. This season, the Lillard-McCollum backcourt has a combined defensive real plus/minus of -3.44 (Lillard’s <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/page/3/sort/DRPM/position/1" target="_blank">horrendous -3.11</a> is what’s skewing that metric). When Horford’s respectable +1.78 enters the picture, that Portland nucleus becomes a bit more stable.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Barnes has usually defended superbly at the NBA level. In the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/year/2014/sort/DRPM/position/5" target="_blank">2013-14 season</a>, Barnes had a defensive real plus/minus of -0.48; however, the next season, he improved that to +1.23, which was top ten amongst all eligible small forwards. This year, he’s regressed a bit to a -1.19, though his ankle injury mid-season may be to blame. Missing all of December with that injury probably set his defensive contributions back quite a bit, but on a defense anchored by Draymond Green (defensive real plus/minus of +4.71) and Andrew Bogut (+5.19), Harrison’s regression isn’t too worrisome.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">If titles are the goal for Barnes, then Golden State, in its current incarnation, offers the most value. But by leaving for the Trail Blazers in free agency, he can take the mini-max and know that he hasn’t sacrificed financial security over long-term winning potential. If Horford also places his faith in Olshey and the Blazers organization, then we would have the beginnings of yet another title contender in the West. Portland is heading to the playoffs this season despite losing Nic Batum, LaMarcus Aldridge, Robin Lopez, and Wesley Matthews to free agency. With Horford and Barnes, heading to the NBA Finals would be the reality for the next four to five seasons.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">As this free agency period arrives, the superstars will garner much of the media headlines. Kevin Durant’s unpredictable future has everyone, including former teammate <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/boston/celtics/post/_/id/4722691/kendrick-perkins-on-kevin-durants-home-next-year-hes-got-a-few-teams-that-he-will-be-looking-at" target="_blank">Kendrick Perkins</a>, venturing an opinion. And while a Kevin Durant or a DeMar DeRozan can change the outlook of a franchise immediately, it is going to be guys like Marvin Williams and Al Horford who have the most long-term impact.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Can Marvin Williams help Detroit to a Finals appearance?</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Will Horford assist in creating a supernova waiting to burst in Portland?</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">I don’t know.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">And as the great <a href="http://grantland.com/features/simmons-oklahoma-city-thunder-nba-championship/" target="_blank">Bill Simmons</a> once said, “That’s the thing about the NBA: You NEVER know.” You can only hope the craziness will falter in the face of logical minds. And Al Horford and Marvin Williams, thankfully, are the coolest cats in the business, so with a watchful eye towards their career-defining future, they’ll begin to navigate the NBA playoffs for their respective teams, knowing full well that their moment may come elsewhere.</p></div>
