				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">On Friday, January 22, the Los Angeles Clippers made the pilgrimage to the Mecca of basketball, Madison Square Garden, to commence battle with the 22-22 New York Knicks. That game was pivotal for many reasons. First, it would mark the start of a raging tire fire within the Knicks organization. Second, the NYC-based club had gone 7-4 in the month of January; however, after that evening’s 116-88 loss to the Clippers, they would go on to lose nine out of their next ten games.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Finally, the precipitous dropoff would spell the end of Derek Fisher’s head coaching career with the Knicks, and it would only increase the doubts regarding Phil Jackson’s capabilities at the helm. The Los Angeles Clippers, who squeezed out eight more wins (out of 11) following that January win against the Knicks, saw the fumbling Knicks as merely a small nuisance that required some attention. The Clips’ star man Blake Griffin was out at the time nursing an injured quad, and on January 26, just four short days later, ESPN reported that Griffin had been <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/14651663/los-angeles-clippers-forward-blake-griffin-injured-hand-fight-member-team-equipment-staff" target="_blank">involved in an altercation</a> with a team staffer, and had injured his right (shooting) hand in the process.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Justifiably, Griffin began to face immense scrutiny for his deleterious actions, which were compounded by the fact that the Clippers had gone 11-3 even without Griffin’s otherworldly hooping talents doing their part. In fact, in the time of Griffin’s absence (dating back to Christmas Day), the Clippers have gone 19-5, with their latest victory coming last night against a Spurs team lacking Kawhi Leonard. So, how can a Clips team lacking their superstar actually start winning more than ever <em>without</em> him?</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The answer lies, in part, with exactly <em>who</em> gets Griffin’s team-leading 18.4 field goal attempts per game (8th-most in the NBA). Before Blake’s injury on Christmas Day, Chris Paul, the fulcrum of the Clippers’ pick-and-roll game, was only averaging <a href="http://stats.nba.com/league/player/#!/?sort=FGA&dir=1&Season=2015-16&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&TeamID=1610612746&DateFrom=10%2F28%2F2015&DateTo=12%2F25%2F2015" target="_blank">13.8 field goal attempts per game</a> (FGA). In the 24 games since Blake’s absence, Paul’s FGA mark <a href="http://stats.nba.com/league/player/#!/?sort=FGA&dir=1&Season=2015-16&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&TeamID=1610612746&DateFrom=12%2F26%2F2015&DateTo=02%2F19%2F2016" target="_blank">has improved to 16.9</a>, without a discernible loss in accuracy. In the past, the argument could be made that Blake’s dominance offensively allowed CP3 to take-and-make easier shots. However, his absence has shown that Paul can not only increase his production, without losing efficiency, but he can also star in those comical “<a href="https://youtu.be/WDcuKcUom10" target="_blank">Meet the Hoopers</a>” State Farm ads.</p></div>
				
				<div class="video_container"><iframe class="youtube_video" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/xG6BPv37ap8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Speaking of the Hoopers, Paul’s wife(?) in the ad, DeAndre Jordan, has also had a productive time of things. With Blake alongside him, DeAndre was shooting a league-high 70.4% from the field (5.6 FGA). Without Blake’s domineering presence, DeAndre has bumped up the shooting to 7.0 FGA per game, while still shooting that sky-high 70%. While DeAndre was busy blocking 2.1 shots per game without Blake, the Clippers quietly dispatched Josh Smith, who was <a href="http://stats.nba.com/league/player/#!/?sort=FGA&dir=1&Season=2015-16&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&TeamID=1610612746&DateFrom=12%2F26%2F2015&DateTo=02%2F19%2F2016" target="_blank">shooting a dreadful 30% from the field</a> even after Blake’s injury, back to the Houston Rockets on January 23rd (three days before Blake’s fateful altercation).</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">And that’s where the Clippers have benefitted the most. Shipping off Smith and his low, low shooting percentage off to Houston has been a boon for the Clippers’ efficiency. Here’s how Austin Rivers has fared following Blake’s absence and Smith’s departure:</p></div>
				
				<img src="feb-nba-article-images/table-rivers.png" class="each_epl_image">
		
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Though he’s played in only six of the sans-Smith and sans-Griffin line-ups, Rivers has clearly profited from no longer having to alter his game to grant Smith unnecessary shots. But above all else, Austin Rivers is a shooter, <a href="http://stats.nba.com/tracking/#!/player/possessions/?CF=TEAM_ABBREVIATION*E*LAC&Season=2015-16&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&sort=AVG_SEC_PER_TOUCH&dir=1" target="_blank">taking as much time as he desires (and countless dribbles)</a> before finally weaving his way to the painted area; or, as is his wont, jacking up one of those highly questionable 3s (he’s shooting a maddening 28.4% from 3-pt land this season). And he was improving at his craft and steadily becoming more efficient post-Christmas.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">While many Clippers have seen their shot count rise following Blake’s stint on the sideline, not all of them have experienced Austin Rivers-levels of efficiency. Wesley Johnson was called upon to take more of the shooting responsibilities in Blake’s absence, but has found it inordinately difficult to make shots. Since Johnson’s game benefitted from the havoc Griffin created (alongside Jordan and CP3), not having Blake means Johnson resembles the type of player he was during his Laker days: A heavily-defended shooter.</p></div>
				
				<img src="feb-nba-article-images/table-johnson.png" class="each_epl_image">
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But for every Wesley Johnson, the Clippers have managed to eke out successful gains from their other talents. Jamal Crawford has experienced the most success from this aspect. When Blake was around, Crawford was the Clips’ fourth option, in terms of field goals attempted, and he wasn’t making as many as he should have, either. With Griffin gone, Crawford has had to increase his FGA count, but this extra work has only positively influenced his production, raising his FG% from 36.5% to 43.6% without Blake Griffin.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Sure, Crawford is still as turnover-prone as ever, but then again, even Chris Paul has committed close to three turnovers per game, with or without Blake Griffin.</p></div>
				
				<img src="feb-nba-article-images/table-crawford.png" class="each_epl_image">
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Even Lance “Born Ready” Stephenson got in on the act! Following Blake’s injury, Lance made it his official business to make em dance, shooting a lights out 64% from the field. Unfortunately, Lance’s time in LA came to an end yesterday when he was dealt to the Memphis Grizzlies in exchange for Jeff Green.</p></div>
				
				<img src="feb-nba-article-images/table-lance.png" class="each_epl_image">
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">While Lance will be sorely missed by Doc Rivers’s medicine cabinet, his burgeoning influence was truly marvelous to watch. But with Lance and his 4.8 FGA gone, the Stephenson shots will now naturally be dispersed throughout the roster just as they were when Blake went out. And the player that will benefit the most from this is JJ Redick.</p></div>
				
				<img src="feb-nba-article-images/table-redick.png" class="each_epl_image">
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In addition to being a <a href="https://art19.com/shows/vertical-jj-redick" target="_blank">newfound podcasting sensation</a>, the shooting guard from Duke has lit up the scoreboard in Blake’s absence. His 3s have never looked crisper, and his catch-and-shoot game will only benefit with CP3 still around to do the assisting. Jeff Green’s arrival should take some shots away from JJ, but Green’s drive-and-dish game should give Redick plenty of open looks.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This season has been touted as one of the final chances for the “Big Three” of Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, and DeAndre Jordan to still reign supreme over Lob City. Griffin’s name was already thrown around in the weeks leading up to the trade deadline and Paul’s will soon follow in the offseason, if the Clips crash out in the opening rounds of the playoffs. For a number of reasons, NBA writers are hesitant to place them in the “elite” strata of teams, where the Spurs, Warriors, Cavaliers, and Thunder have resided since the start of the campaign.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The 19-5 record without Blake Griffin should be both inspiring and a building block. But their 17-13 record <em>with</em> Blake is just as demoralizing. The story of the Clippers follows the story of their own superstar: They get in their own way, at times.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">They have a Saturday evening clash tomorrow at Staples against Golden State. Two whole months have gone by since their November 19 clash, when the Warriors defeated the Clippers 124-117. Since then, Blake has become a spectator, JJ has shot lights out, CP3 has done CP3 things, DeAndre has impressed, Jamal has improved, and Austin has proved his worth. The rabble-rousers (<a href="https://youtu.be/7hgtqwLwEDc" target="_blank">Josh Smith and Lance Stephenson</a>) have departed.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">All of this change has taken place and the Clippers are still stronger than ever. Hopefully, that toughness and growth bear some fruits over the next 28, because the playoffs will demand that much and more.</p></div>
