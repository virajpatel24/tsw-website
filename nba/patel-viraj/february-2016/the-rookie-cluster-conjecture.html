				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">As an experiment, ask most NBA fans, “Hey, which rookie has impressed you the most this season?” The answers will have some consensus choices, but they’ll ostensibly deviate from one another; however, one thing is for certain: Most answers will contain either the New York Knicks’ Latvian power forward Kristaps Porzingis or the Minnesota Timberwolves’ Dominican power forward Karl Anthony-Towns. And that’s just fine.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">While the Rookie of the Year race is shaping up to be <a href="../../brahmbhatt-teerth/december-2015/theyve-got-game.html">a two-horse race between these two non-American youngsters</a>, when we project with the long-term in mind, it’s evident that we may be undervaluing some rookies that have outperformed this season. Instead of focusing on the top four picks in the 2015 NBA Draft, we need to hone in on picks eight to thirteen, since that’s where the defining legacy of this draft lies. This cluster of rookies, hailing from America’s finest college basketball programs - Arizona, Duke, Texas, Wisconsin, and Kentucky, has provided some unique insights into the development of a successful lottery pick.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Pick No. 8: Stanley Johnson, Forward, Detroit Pistons (College: Arizona)</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">After being heavily recruited by some of the nation’s elite college basketball programs, Stanley Johnson decided to hedge his bets on Sean Miller and the University of Arizona. Johnson’s first and final year in Tucson ended superbly as he started in 38 games, averaging 13.8 PTS, 6.5 REB, 1.7 AST, and 1.5 STL en route to first-team All-Pac-12 and Pac-12 Freshman of the Year honors. But despite the great season with Arizona, the Anaheim native’s name was still firmly entrenched in the middle picks of the lottery by the time he’d declared for the NBA Draft.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">FiveThirtyEight’s CARMELO player projection model believed that Johnson’s NBA career would model that of <a href="http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/stanley-johnson/" target="_blank">veteran workhorse Luol Deng</a>, which is a fair appraisal of Johnson’s talents. And thus far, that projection seems to be ringing true since Johnson’s 2015-16 season stats roughly mirror those of Luol Deng’s first Bulls season (2004-05).  The key difference is that while Deng has always been a mid-45% shooter from the field, Johnson’s rookie campaign has shown that he’s still having difficulties cracking even 40%. But, thus far, Johnson’s 3-pt shot has slightly exceeded that of Deng’s during his rookie season in Chicago. Johnson currently takes 2.8 threes a game while making 0.9 of them (32.1%), while Deng took 1.9 of them in his rookie season and only converted on 0.5 (26.5%). CARMELO Anthony they’re not.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But when CARMELO’s algorithms projected the Johnson-Deng comparison, I’m sure defense was considered. And true to form, this is where Johnson closely mirrors his veteran comparison, who built a reputation for being one of the toughest defenders in the NBA during those Chicago years. While Johnson’s Pistons team places in the bottom third in the NBA <a href="http://stats.nba.com/league/team/defense/#!/?sort=D_FG_PCT&dir=-1" target="_blank">in terms of defensive efficiency</a>, Johnson himself is one of the Pistons’ <a href="http://stats.nba.com/tracking/#!/player/defense/?CF=TEAM_ABBREVIATION*E*DET%7CMIN*GE*10&sort=DEF_RIM_FG_PCT&dir=-1&Season=2015-16&SeasonType=Regular%20Season" target="_blank">best off-ball defenders</a>. When he is actually guarding a player, though, he is prone to overcompensating and, as a result, checks in as <a href="http://stats.nba.com/league/player/defense/#!/?CF=GP*GE*20&Season=2015-16&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&TeamID=1610612765&sort=D_FG_PCT&dir=-1" target="_blank">a middle-of-the-pack defensive player</a> on the Pistons when playing on-ball defense.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But if he’s persistent enough on both ends of his development, then he’ll be well on his way to consistently architecting superb two-way plays, like these ones against the Nets last night, for example.</p></div>
				
				<div class="video_container"><iframe class="youtube_video" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/B8VBft9mZhU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Pick No. 9: Frank Kaminsky, Forward/Center, Charlotte Hornets (College: Wisconsin)</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Frank Kaminsky came within five points of a NCAA National Championship last year when his Wisconsin side blazed through the NCAA Tournament before they lost by five to Coach K’s Duke. Kaminsky’s college coach, Bo Ryan, did wonders for his development as a 3-pt shooting, away-from-the-rim crashing, rim-protecting center that simply dominated at the college level during his senior season in Wisconsin. But while Big Ten defenses failed to stop this seven-footer from Illinois, NBA defenses had seemingly <a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/sports/nba/charlotte-hornets/article25992190.html" target="_blank">cracked the code</a> on Frank the Tank mere seconds into his NBA career.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">On defense, Kaminsky stands to vastly improve. His slow feet-shuffling on defense has him routinely out of position when going against the biggest forwards and centers, like DeMarcus Cousins and Rudy Gobert. But with Al Jefferson out, and Cody Zeller and Spencer Hawes having some tough times here and there, it seemed like the starting role was Kaminsky’s for the taking these past few weeks, which he failed to seize. Moreover, his sub-40% field goal percentage probably didn’t help matters when combined with his <a href="http://stats.nba.com/league/player/defense/#!/?CF=GP*GE*20&Season=2015-16&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&TeamID=1610612766&sort=D_FG_PCT&dir=-1" target="_blank">lagging defensive efficiency</a>.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">So far, while we have not seen many glimpses of that 50%+ field goal percentage or the 40%+ 3-pt shooting that set him apart at Wisconsin, there have been a few possessions here and there where it seems like Michael Jordan and the Hornets did not pick a bust (especially when they had the opportunity to go for someone like Justise Winslow or Myles Turner). Only time will tell whether Kaminsky was worth the ninth selection, but in the mean time, as Frank the Tank adjusts to the NBA, we can only hope that he keeps improving his sense of timing on the pick-and-roll, while making sure to help his teammates snag a few offensive rebounds from time-to-time. Basically, it means doing the exact opposite of whatever he’s doing on these two possessions against the lowly Lakers on January 31, 2016.</p></div>
				
				<div class="video_container"><iframe class="youtube_video" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/oq-4ofJ_ty0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Pick No. 10: Justise Winslow, Guard/Forward, Miami Heat (College: Duke)</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">While folks criticized Michael Jordan’s Hornets for selecting Frank Kaminsky in the 2015 NBA Draft, Pat Riley and the Miami Heat’s selection of Duke forward Justise Winslow was almost universally applauded. First off, it dumbfounded me as to how anyone who saw Winslow play at the college level could not snag him in the top six. Did the Lakers, Kings, and Nuggets forget that Winslow was easily the best player (aside from Jahlil Okafor) on a Coach K-led Duke team that walked its way to a National title?</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Simply put, NBA executives focused too much on the fact that his offensive contributions would disappoint and never surpass his defensive prowess, which is an easy mistake to make. And, on that note, those teams and executives who chose to pass on Winslow are correct…for now. While Winslow’s meager offensive output of 5.8 PTS, 4.9 REB, 1.4 AST, in 27.6 minutes of playing time each night won’t knock your socks off, his defensive capabilities have been one the catalysts of a Heat team figuring out how to rule South Beach in the post-King James era.</p></div>
				
				<div class="video_container"><iframe class="youtube_video" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/yYp8DqlDL8Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But as the clip above shows, Winslow’s dogged determination on defense far and above outweighs any shortcomings on the offensive end. On a Heat team featuring the scoring talents of Chris Bosh, Dwayne Wade, Goran Dragic, among others, Winslow’s development needs to be focusing exactly on where it currently is: Playing excellent, sustainable defense on some of the league’s best forwards. If that means <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400828602" target="_blank">holding the Hawks’ Kyle Korver to zero points on the night</a> while providing limited offensive production, then so be it.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Besides, it’s not as if Winslow doesn’t realize that he needs to improve his offensive game in due time. And other superstars around the league are taking note of this, too. Here’s the Pacers’ Paul George remarking on Winslow’s evolving game to <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/ethan-j-skolnick/article53214885.html" target="_blank">Ethan J. Skolnick of the <em>Miami Herald</em></a>:</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“It’s good he’s getting the big matchups now, and then it’s all about experience over time,” George said. “The same with Kawhi [Leonard] and myself, we gradually got bigger roles and bigger situations. He’ll make his name on the defensive end for sure.”</p>
					
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">And just for fun, here’s the comparisons between the rookie season of Justise Winslow and those of Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, and Draymond Green, who are all among the league’s best two-way forwards:</p></div>
				
				<img src="feb-nba-article-images/table-winslow.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">CHART'S STATISTICS COURTESY OF <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/" target="_blank">WWW.BASKETBALL-REFERENCE.COM</a></p>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">As the table above indicates, Winslow’s progressing at a decent rate and is outshining the likes of Draymond Green in most categories. So, given access to Wade’s leadership, Bosh’s teachings, and Erik Spoelstra’s coaching, it seems as if Justise Winslow is in the best environment possible for a rookie looking to prosper.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Pick No. 11: Myles Turner, Center, Indiana Pacers (College: Texas)</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Speaking of veteran leadership and effective coaching, the Indiana Pacers’ Myles Turner also finds himself in a great situation. Additionally, similar to Miami’s situation with Pat Riley, the Indiana club also has a living legend orchestrating the whole juggernaut from above named Larry Bird, who collected three NBA titles on his way to a Hall of Fame career with the Boston Celtics in the 1980s.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Turner, who initially saw minutes earlier in the season, began to get phased out by Frank Vogel until early January 2016. When Turner was given the chance to see some consistent playing time for the Pacers these past few weeks, he seized it and didn’t look back. In fact, last night’s enthralling performance against the Cleveland Cavaliers – 14 points, 10 rebounds, and four blocks – was just marvelous to watch.</p></div>
				
				<div class="video_container"><iframe class="youtube_video" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/10gGwCoMRW8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">For the time being, it seems like Myles Turner has simply played his way onto Frank Vogel’s starting lineups for the foreseeable future. His <a href="http://stats.nba.com/league/player/defense/#!/lt6/?Season=2015-16&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&TeamID=1610612754&sort=LT_06_PCT&dir=-1" target="_blank">rim protection</a> and rebounding have come in handy, since Jordan Hill and Ian Mahinmi are not the Pacers’ best defensive options when they go big. It is now Turner’s job to lose.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Pick No. 12: Trey Lyles, Forward, Utah Jazz (College: Kentucky)</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Since the Utah Jazz already have big men Rudy Gobert and Derrick Favors at their disposal, it would make sense if Trey Lyles had little to no production this season. But since Gobert and Favors have also been injury-prone in their careers (this season being no different), the Jazz smartly pulled off one of the best picks of the 2015 NBA Draft.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The 6’10’’ Lyles burst onto the scene for Quin Snyder’s Jazz team in early December when he started seeing decent minutes on a nightly basis as the team struggled to cope with the Favors and Gobert injury stints. Just like Myles Turner in Indiana, Lyles had seen some action early in the season, but then lost favor, since his raw skills had a difficult time adjusting to the pace-and-space revolution of the NBA.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>NOVEMBER 2015</b> – 2.3 PTS, 2.0 REB, 0.2 AST in 11 games (8.4 minutes per game)</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>DECEMBER 2015</b> - 4.1 PTS, 4.9 REB, 0.9 AST in 15 games (20.9 minutes per game)</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>JANUARY 2016</b> – 8.0 PTS, 5.1 REB, 1.1 AST in 15 games (25.1 minutes per game)</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">After that rough November, Lyles saw his stats soar in most of the major categories as 2015 departed and 2016 arrived. With Favors and Gobert now healthy once more, Lyles’ minutes will see a predictable decline. But the fact remains that when he’s given consistent playing time, his performances elevate, as the month of January has shown. And as the 22-25 Jazz team angles itself for a playoffs push, Lyles’ defensive presence and off-the-bench production will come in handy for Quin Snyder.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Pick No. 13: Devin Booker, Guard, Phoenix Suns (College: Kentucky)</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In his rookie campaign in Phoenix, Suns guard Devin Booker has experienced it all. He’s experienced the lows of being on a 14-35 Phoenix team while simultaneously seeing the highs of his young career when he posted an efficient 32-point outing in a 97-94 loss to the Indiana Pacers on January 19th. In that very game, Brandon Knight suffered an injury that would sideline him for the next few weeks, which gave rise to the highly efficient scoring-assisting duo of Archie Goodwin and Devin Booker, who look like a capable second unit to that formidable, but oft-injured Eric Bledsoe-Brandon Knight first unit.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">FiveThirtyEight’s <a href="http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/devin-booker/" target="_blank">CARMELO model</a> rated the 19-year-old Booker as a “Good Prospect” and projected that Booker’s NBA tenure would mimic that of Zach LaVine, who’s having an excellent year in Minnesota (12.7 PTS, 3.1 AST, 3.0 REB in 49 games). But while LaVine is stuck in the frozen tundra of Minnesota on a 14-35 T-Wolves team, his team’s future is a bit brighter than that of Booker’s because of the talent that surrounds LaVine: Karl Anthony-Towns, Andrew Wiggins, Ricky Rubio, and Kevin Garnett’s incessant rambling.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Booker, on the other hand, is stuck on a Phoenix team that just fired its head coach and unlike the Cavs, who executed a similar firing recently, it doesn’t seem like Phoenix will undergo a renewed sense of belief and optimism in their near future. Unlike Tyronn Lue, who has King James, Kyrie Irving, and Kevin Love at his disposal, the Suns’ new head coach, Earl Watson, has the injured Eric Bledsoe (out for the year), the once-effective Tyson Chandler, a star in Brandon Knight, and a whole lot of other problems that are around simply because of a losing record.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But that’s where Devin Booker and his 10.0 PTS, 1.5 AST, and 1.9 REB stat line comes in handy. Booker is having a fantastic time of it in the past few months, as his production and playing time have increased.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>NOVEMBER 2015</b> – 4.5 PTS, 1.2 REB, 0.5 AST in 11 games (12.2 minutes per game)</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Having seen a starter’s minutes in January, Booker will only hope that the new Earl Watson regime will continue to promulgate his cause. I mean, it’s not like the Suns have any other options, right? And if Booker delivers, then the Suns know they have a rising shooting star on their hands. If he doesn’t, then they whiffed on a No. 13 lottery pick, which is not the worst thing in the world for a 14-35 club.</p></div>
