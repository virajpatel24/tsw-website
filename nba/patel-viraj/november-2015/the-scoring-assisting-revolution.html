				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">“A smart assist is the best assist,” quips the <a href="https://youtu.be/le0_9ESD3gA" target="_blank">Stephen Curry-led State Farm ad</a> in its closing seconds. Of course, Dr. Sebastian Curry’s knowledge of the insurance game, fueled by a “Masters in Disasters” and a “Ph.D. in Calamity,” is a welcome bonus for those of us searching for qualified insurance salesmen. But its the antics of his twin brother, Stephen, that have captured the NBA’s attention in just a little over a dozen games into this 2015–2016 season.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">When not appearing in State Farm ads, Stephen Curry has spent the better part of the last six seasons transforming into one of the best point guards the NBA has ever seen. Not only is he always due for a breathtaking assist every few possessions, he is already the best shooting point guard to ever step foot on a basketball court. And it’s not like he doesn’t have competition for that distinction: Russell Westbrook, another scoring-passing-blitzing tornado of destruction from OKC, led the league in scoring last year and Stephen Curry (MVP, 23.8 PPG, 7.7 AST), Kyrie Irving (21.7 PPG, 5.2 APG), Damian Lillard (21.0 PPG, 6.2 APG), Chris Paul (19.1 PPG, 10.2 APG), and John Wall (17.6 PPG, 10.0 APG) were not too far behind in terms of performance.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But this season, coming off of a triumphant NBA Finals earlier in the summer, Curry has gotten even <em>better</em>. In fact, almost every other chief competitor to Curry’s “Best Point Guard in the NBA” title has also improved in most areas (or slightly declined) from last season to this season.</p></div>
				
				<img src="nov-nba-article-images/table-1.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">ALL STATS COURTESY OF <a href="stats.nba.com" target="_blank">STATS.NBA.COM</a></p>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Of that collection of players I mentioned, Curry has had the largest PPG difference from last season (and last season he won the MVP award) with a resounding +10.4 swing.</p></div>
				
				<img src="nov-nba-article-images/table-2.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">ALL STATS COURTESY OF <a href="stats.nba.com" target="_blank">STATS.NBA.COM</a></p>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Chris Paul and John Wall both put up staggering assists per game marks last season with 10.2 and 10.0, respectively. This season, while they’re both close to those levels once again, the gap is still too large to close down. But the player that has improved the most from the assists standpoint is the Thunder’s Russell Westbrook, who has experienced the largest season-to-season swing at +1.8. In fact, Westbrook put up 11 triple-doubles last season (the next closest was James Harden at four). This season, Westbrook has two (surpassed only by Rajon Rondo, who has four already), but the thing is Westbrook came close (within two assists or rebounds from achieving a triple-double) in five other games — and getting to the ten points was never the issue for Furious Styles.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Someone whose assist numbers increased this season is Damian Lillard, who lost his best pick-and-roll option LaMarcus Aldridge to the San Antonio Spurs this offseason. Lillard still posts 6.7 APG in a frontcourt featuring the likes of Meyers Leonard, Mason Plumlee, and Al-Farouq Aminu (who replaces Nicolas Batum at the three). Wesley Matthews, the Blazers’ shooting guard, also jetted off to Dallas this offseason. Interestingly enough, the Lillard-Aldridge tandem was responsible for 1.7 of Lillard’s 6.2 assists per game last season while the Lillard-Matthews and the Lillard-Batum parings checked in at 1.1 and 0.7 APG, respectively.</p></div>

				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a href="https://www.facebook.com/trailblazers/photos/a.10153339761671137.1073741831.20214931136/10153339772906137/" target="_blank">PORTLAND TRAILBLAZERS FACEBOOK ACCOUNT</a></p>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This season, the Lillard-Meyers pairing is responsible for 1.5 of Lillard's 6.7 APG while the Lillard-Plumlee, Lillard-Aminu, and Lillard-McCollum tandems come in at 1.1, 1.1, and 0.8, respectively. Though he’s operating with a markedly inferior cast and crew this season, Damian Lillard has still produced positive outputs with both his scoring and assisting in Portland.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Meanwhile in Golden State, the reigning league MVP, Stephen Curry, went from 7.7 APG last season to only 5.8 APG through the first 13 games of this campaign. But much like Curry’s silky-smooth scoring abilities, Curry’s declining assists numbers can be deceptive at first look. Remember what Chef Curry’s State Farm ads preach? <em>A smart assist is the best assist.</em></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">And smart assists are exactly what Curry has been dishing out during these first 13 games of the season. In fact, while his 5.8 APG number is the 21st-best in the league this year, Curry leads the league in a lesser-known stat called the “secondary assist.” A secondary assist is the equivalent of the “hockey assist,” which is awarded to NHL players who make the pass that leads to the final pass that results in the goal. And guess who is leading the NBA with 2.9 secondary APG?</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Stephen Wardell Curry II.</p></div>
				
				<img src="nov-nba-article-images/curry-jay-z.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SportsCenter/photos/a.166942843324566.37299.147262525292598/1262537217098451/" target="_blank">SPORTSCENTER FACEBOOK ACCOUNT</a></p>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">So the natural question would be the following: Who is the player in-between that takes Curry’s secondary assist and makes the final, timely pass to the player that scores the basket? Draymond Green.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">While his point guard checks in at number 21 in the league’s assists leaderboard this season, Draymond Green takes up seventh place with his team-high 7.1 APG. And the player that Green receives the most passes from every game is Stephen Curry (<a href="http://stats.nba.com/player/#!/201939/tracking/passes/?p=stephen-curry&Season=2015-16&SeasonType=Regular%20Season" target="_blank">the duo exchange 20.9 passes between themselves</a> and this has resulted in Green accounting for 1.4 of Curry’s 5.8 APG this season). So while Curry leads the team (and the NBA) in secondary assists, Green leads the Warriors in assists. Not a bad trade-off for a team playing small-ball basketball to perfection.</p></div>
				
				<div class="video_container"><iframe class="youtube_video" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/jb9PhXEOLM4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
			
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">A team that definitely does not play small-ball can be found in Los Angeles. No, not the Lakers. The 2–9 Lakers can play small-ball, big-ball, or anything in between and still not produce much of value on the hardwood given their current performances. Instead, their same-arena rivals, the Los Angeles Clippers, are the prime example of a team built to chug along with perennial big men DeAndre Jordan and Blake Griffin. The Clips’ plethora of shooters like Paul Pierce, J.J. Redick, Josh Smith, and Lance “make em dance” Stephenson provide spacing and room for the team’s point guard Chris Paul.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Contrary to Curry’s league-leading 2.9 secondary assists, <a href="http://stats.nba.com/tracking/#!/player/passing/?sort=SECONDARY_AST&dir=1" target="_blank">Paul has posted roughly half that amount</a> at 1.4. But CP3’s lower secondary assists number makes sense because of the fact that if you’re on the receiving end of one of Paul’s dimes, you will have acres of space to get a shot up, set up a picnic table, enjoy the free time, see the shot clank out, and have Chris Paul yell at you for missing the shot before your opposition defender arrives to play last-ditch defense. Basically, as Kirk Goldsberry mentioned in his <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/chris-paul-is-a-point-god/" target="_blank">Chris Paul feature this week for FiveThirtyEight</a>, “good things happen on the business end of a Chris Paul dime.”</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This season, if you find yourself on the end of a Russell Westbrook dime, good things will also happen. Westbrook, as alluded to previously, has been tearing through teams this season by posting a league-leading 10.4 APG (in addition to his 28.1 PPG), but his potential assists number checks in at a blistering 19.1 APG (the “potential assist” is recorded when a player makes a pass that, if converted by the receiving player, would’ve counted as an assist). Leading the league in potential assists is as much a stark reminder of Westbrook’s otherworldly court vision and talents as it is of the low caliber of players surrounding him. Other than Kevin Durant (who’s out due to injury) and Serge Ibaka, the Thunder lack catch-and-shoot players who can consistently nail down open jumpers that result from Westbrook’s defense-splitting play.</p></div>
				
				<img src="nov-nba-article-images/table-3.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">ALL STATS COURTESY OF <a href="stats.nba.com" target="_blank">STATS.NBA.COM</a></p>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Alongside fellow triple-double machine Rajon Rondo, Westbrook has created an NBA player worth 24.0 points per game simply as a result of his playmaking. So in addition to scoring 28.1 points every game all by his lonesome, Westbrook has produced a Damian Lillard (25.1 PPG) or Carmelo Anthony (23.1 PPG) type of scoring via his assists.</p></div>
				
				<img src="nov-nba-article-images/table-4.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">ALL STATS COURTESY OF <a href="stats.nba.com" target="_blank">STATS.NBA.COM</a></p>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Accordingly, Westbrook leads this year’s class of point guards with 52.1 total points created per game. The NBA’s leading scorer, Stephen Curry, comes in second at a rate of 47.4. Across the other positions, only James Harden and LeBron James come even close to these two with a mark of 44.6 and 42.4, respectively.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">As the league evolves from a post-up driven old-school organization into an analytics-oriented, small-ball conglomeration, the teams that have these types of passing-scoring dynamic players, paired with catch-and-shoot knockdown scorers, will find themselves in the midst of the postseason for a number of years. Pass-first point guards like Chris Paul are still in demand (this is why Ricky Rubio and Rajon Rondo are still around), but only if they can put up Curry-esqe scoring numbers as well. But, more and more, the league’s executives will seek out young players that encompass both Russell Westbrook’s firepower and desire to create plays alongside Stephen Curry’s effortless ability to knock down off-the-dribble and catch-and-shoot jumpshots. Oh, and passing ability?</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">That’s a must-have, too.</p></div>
