				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">No, I’m not directing a sequel to the awesome 90’s basketball movie, “He’s Got Game,” but you should watch it if you haven’t seen it yet. Instead, I’m talking about this year’s exceptional rookie class of the NBA. This year’s class has proven to be better than good and, in some cases, they have proven to be potential future-changing draft picks for their respective teams.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Ironically, when it comes to making projections for this year’s draft class, much of the hype had been subdued. In fact, many analysts were sure of who the top picks would be and also who the front-runners for rookie of the year (ROY) would end up being. To quote a <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2510318-nba-draft-2015-results-grades-for-all-30-franchises" target="_blank">Bleacher Report piece analyzing the draft decisions of the top teams</a>, “There shouldn't be any qualms from the fan bases in the top five. There are qualms, I know. There just shouldn't be any.”  Each faction, whether it be the fans or the teams, was so sure everything would play out as the top five had been scripted. So as we approach the two-month mark of the season, let’s take a look at some of the top-performing rookies.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b><u>Karl Anthony-Towns</u></b></p></div>

				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nba/photos/a.10153394752913463.1073742087.8245623462/10153394754548463/" target="_blank">NBA FACEBOOK ACCOUNT</a></p>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Karl-Anthony Towns (KAT) has had a pretty awesome start to his first NBA season, which probably doesn’t come as a surprise to many of you seeing as he was the first player selected within the draft. However, before we jump into his exploits this season, I wanted to go over some of the projections concerning his NBA career arc. In recent years, this has become a huge point of discussion for every draft selection. In order to get a sense of each of these players’ career arc, we will be using <a href="http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/" target="_blank">the CARMELO NBA player projection algorithm</a>, compiled and available for anyone’s use at FiveThirtyEight. When it comes to KAT, the algorithm projected him as a great prospect using his adjusted college statistics. So you might think, “Isn’t this what the number one overall pick is supposed to be? A great prospect?” Yes, you would be right in saying that. But here is the top five players, in likeness, that the CARMELO model projected KAT would be like in terms of wins above replacement (WAR).</p></div>
				
				<img src="dec-nba-article-images/chart-1.png" class="each_epl_image">
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">To quickly explain the statistic of similarity: A zero in the model means that the two players have average similarity, while a score of 100 is the highest possible similarity two players can have. The irony here is that the model projected that KAT would be most similar to Anthony Bennett, the guy that was once Cleveland’s number one overall pick, who many consider to be a bust even at this early point in his career. In fact, Anthony Bennett was supposed to be KAT’s team mate; however, due to the glut of power forwards that would have been on the team, the T-wolves <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/13723920/minnesota-timberwolves-buy-anthony-bennett-36m" target="_blank">decided to buy out his contract</a> rather than try and find another way to utilize his unique set of skills.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">When we look at a comparison of the two players’ stats we see why this may be such a big deal, as a projection that wasn’t very accurate.</p></div>
				
				<img src="dec-nba-article-images/kat-comparison.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">TABLE CREATED USING <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.cgi?request=1&sum=0&y1=2016&p1=townska01&y2=2014&p2=bennean01&y3=2009&p3=odengr01&y4=2012&p4=favorde01&y5=2007&p5=thomaty01&y6=2007&p6=willima02" target="_blank">WWW.BASKETBALL-REFERENCE.COM</a></p>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">As we look to the per game number for the comparisons of these players, we see that KAT is 1st in points, much higher than Anthony Bennett at an equivalent 20 years old. The player that came the closest in this projection for points per game (PPG) was Greg Oden, who was actually 21 at the time of his rookie season. Additionally, KAT is second in effective field goal percentage (eFG%) to Greg Oden’s .564. And lastly he is by far the best three-point shooter out of this group, posting an insane .412; the second highest percentage out of this group was Marvin Williams, who posted a .244 in his equivalent 20-year-old season. And if you recall, when Marvin Williams was drafted out of UNC, he was played alternatively between the three and four spots, KAT will be spending a lot more of his time at the traditional 5 spot, splitting some time with the four as well. He is definitely one of the most effective distance-shooting centers we have seen in quite some time. When you check out the per 36 minute stats we see that the trends from the per game number remain for the most part, except KAT sees a large boost in his points average within the “per 36 minute” numbers. The boost is larger than the one we observe from per game to per 36 minutes for other players within this list.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Finally, we look at the Timberwolves as a team. The model we used to find a likeness of player impact for KAT was the CARMELO model. The CARM-Elo model is another FiveThirtyEight model that combines player ratings (CARMELO) with head-to-head performance projections for teams (Elo). Please <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-our-2015-16-nba-predictions-work/" target="_blank">visit FiveThirtyEight to learn more</a> about how the CARM-Elo and CARMELO models differ. The CARM-Elo model of FiveThirtyEight projected the team to finish 29-53 at the end of the season and to have a 7% chance of making the playoffs. Last year the T-Wolves had a record of 16-66, so 29-53 would be a 13-win improvement, a sign of notable progress in a tough western conference.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b><u>Kristaps Porzingis</u></b></p></div>
				
				<img src="dec-nba-article-images/kp-1.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NYKnicks/photos/a.71815779615.98182.21410634615/10154396548799616/" target="_blank">NEW YORK KNICKS FACEBOOK ACCOUNT</a></p>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Sadly, in the case of Kristaps Porzingis (KP) we do not have CARMELO projections of player WAR comparisons for him. This is mainly because KP did not play in college the year prior to the draft and this is what the projections for rookies were based off of. So instead we will rely on some pre-draft analysis of his abilities. According to <a href="http://www.nba.com/draft/2015/prospects/kristaps_porzingis?ls=iref:nba:draft:tracker" target="_blank">scouting notes compiled by NBA.com</a>, KP's strengths came from his impressive physical measurables, mobility, and athleticism as a seven-foot tall player. And his quick and effective shooting touch was just the cherry on top.  His weaknesses were centered around a lack of aggression, being uncomfortable in the post on offense, slight frame, and lack of defensive awareness and poor rebounding skills. When considering post-draft analysis there was much talk about <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2506389-2015-nba-draft-grades-full-team-by-team-report-cards/page/5" target="_blank">the Knicks fans and even some players possibly being upset with taking KP at number four</a> because he was widely seen as a long-term project that would be limited in contributing during his rookie season.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This is why it has been a surprise for many NBA fans and analysts that KP has been, arguably, one of the best rookies this year and a front-runner along with KAT in the ROY award race. In the NBA.com prospect notes, the player that scouts most compared KP to, given that he lived up to his athletic potential, was Pau Gasol.</p></div>
				
				<img src="dec-nba-article-images/kp-gasol-comparison.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">TABLE CREATED USING <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.cgi?request=1&sum=0&y1=2002&p1=gasolpa01&y2=2016&p2=porzikr01&p3=&p4=&p5=&p6=" target="_blank">WWW.BASKETBALL-REFERENCE.COM</a></p>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">When comparing the per game stats between Pau’s rookie season and KP’s current performance, we see that Pau at age 21 shot better from the field and averaged 17.6 ppg while KP is currently averaging 13.6 ppg. However, both logged large minutes at the center position, with KP shooting .354 from three while Pau, in his rookie season, shot a mediocre .200 from distance. However, this may be the most important statistical comparison of them all: on a per game basis, Pau averaged 8.9 total rebounds, while KP is currently averaging 8.4 total rebounds per game. When we look at the per 36 minute totals, KP averages more rebounds at 11.00 than Pau did at 8.7 rebounds per game. In addition, the 36-minute statistics show that KP is averaging 17.9 ppg, while Pau averaged 17.3 ppg. The per-36 minute statistics shine some light on the impact that the difference in minutes per game has between these two players. KP is currently averaging 27.3 minutes per game, while Pau averaged 36.7 minutes during his rookie campaign for the Grizzlies.</p></div>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">However, as comparable as Pau's rookie season and Kristap's early games have been, the rebounding has been where these two European players diverge the most. As stated in the above <a href="http://www.nba.com/draft/2015/prospects/kristaps_porzingis?ls=iref:nba:draft:tracker" target="_blank">scouting notes from NBA.com</a>, many thought that KP would have trouble rebounding due to his lack of strength. As we can see, he has turned out to be a very capable rebounder as a young player, having similar, if not better, production when compared to a future Hall of Famer like Pau Gasol. Additionally, if we add some context to KP’s offensive PPG numbers, we see that he must share offensive possessions with one of the best offensive players in the league in Carmelo Anthony. When we look at the Grizzlies roster during Pau Gasol’s rookie campaign, we see that he was <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/MEM/2002.html" target="_blank">the highest scoring player on the team</a>, with Jason Williams coming in second at 14.8 ppg.  Compare this to KP, <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/NYK/2016.html" target="_blank">who is the second leading scorer on the Knicks</a>, to Carmelo’s average of 21.8 PPG. This is why Knicks fans should be happy: If anything, KP is ahead of schedule and can only improve from this season onward, meriting the talk of him being a future altering piece for the franchise.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">When looking at the Knicks as a whole, in the 2014-2015 season, the team finished with a lowly 17-65 record. While this year’s squad is projected to finish at a mark of 31-51 according to the <a href="http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-nba-picks/" target="_blank">Carm-Elo team performance predictor model</a> at FiveThirtyEight. The team is projected of having a slim chance of making the playoffs in a tougher eastern conference. However, with the rapid maturation and development of KP, if Phil Jackson adds another solid young piece around him via the 2016 draft, then the future will be bright for the New York Knicks franchise.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">As you can see, this year’s draft class - consisting of studs like Jahlil Okafor, Justice Winslow, Emmanuel Mudiay, D’Angelo Russell, to name a few - has a chance to truly be one of the deepest we have seen in recent years and possibly one of the best of all time. However, there is plenty of basketball still left to be played and so we will have to wait for a few more months before we can officially anoint this rookie class. But till then, like the great philosopher Karl-Anthony Towns once wrote, “‘The harder you work, the harder it is to give up’ – Karl Towns.” No, I’m serious! The dude <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/24/karl-anthony-towns-vice-sports_n_7656838.html" target="_blank">quoted himself and wrote it on his wall</a> when he was growing up. That tidbit alone should be enough to elevate this unique rookie class full of characters.</p></div>
