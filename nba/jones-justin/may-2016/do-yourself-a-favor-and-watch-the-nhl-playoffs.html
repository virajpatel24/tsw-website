				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This year’s NHL Playoffs have featured some of the more memorable sporting moments of recent memory. They have featured no sweeps, and several of the sport’s heavyweights were eliminated in the early rounds.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Most notably, the defending champion Chicago Blackhawks were defeated in an exhilarating seven-game series against the St. Louis Blues. The series came down to the final minutes of game seven, and the Blues ultimately prevailed on Troy Brouwer’s third period game-winner. This game winner came on the heels of Chicago’s comeback from a 3-1 deficit in the series to force a Game 7.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">On the Eastern side of the bracket, the President’s Trophy-winning Washington Capitals were eliminated in the second round in similarly exciting fashion. The gritty Pittsburgh Penguins defeated them in six games, with all but one being decided by one goal. Three of the six games even went to overtime. Oh, and this matchup featured the two greatest players of hockey’s past decade in Alexander Ovechkin and Sidney Crosby.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Both of these aforementioned series, as well as all of the other Stanley Cup playoff series, have featured everything that a sports fan could possibly want. They have shown the fragile lining between victory and defeat, with players’ emotions fully on display as one play determines the outcome of a season. And they have been rich with uncertainty, as top championship contenders have faced the possibility of elimination at nearly every turn.</p></div>
				
				<img src="may-nba-article-images/nhl-playoffs.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">BRACKET COURTESY OF <a href="http://stats.nba.com/playoffs/#!/" target="_blank">WWW.NHL.COM</a></p>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In other words, these Stanly Cup Playoffs have been exactly what the NBA Playoffs have not been. With exception given to the Spurs-Thunder series, these playoffs have been an absolute snore-fest. Now, you may be thinking: there have been some great games and some seven-game series; how can you say these NBA Playoffs aren’t exciting?</p></div>
				
				<img src="may-nba-article-images/nba-playoffs.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">BRACKET COURTESY OF <a href="https://www.nhl.com/stanley-cup-playoffs" target="_blank">WWW.STATS.NBA.COM</a></p>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The answer is relatively simple. As I mentioned before, the NHL Playoffs feature the exciting uncertainty of championship contending teams being eliminated in the first round. This is simply not the case in the NBA.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">When the playoffs began, FiveThirtyEight identified four prohibitive favorites to win the NBA title. Their <a href="http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-nba-picks/" target="_blank">CARM-ELO model</a> projected that one of Golden State, San Antonio, Cleveland, and Oklahoma City had an 85% chance to win the title when the playoffs began. By comparison, the top four NHL teams <a href="http://www.si.com/nhl/2016/04/11/capitals-favored-vegas-win-stanley-cup" target="_blank">only had a 55% chance</a> to win the title according to betting odds from Bovada.lv.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Further, the bottom four NHL playoff teams actually had a respectable combined 13% chance to win the title based on these same betting odds. This compares to the less than one percent chance of winning the title given to the four lowest seeded NBA teams. In fact, the Philadelphia Flyers, the lowest ranked NHL team at 2.94% to win the cup, were given a greater chance of winning the Cup than the Memphis Grizzlies were given to get out of the first round (2%). These same Flyers were estimated to have a greater chance of winning their respective title than all but the top six rated NBA teams by the CARM-ELO model were given of winning the NBA title (GSW, SAS, CLE, OKC, TOR, and LAC).</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">FiveThirtyEight’s CARM-ELO model held true to form through the first round of the NBA playoffs. The top four teams managed to post a record of 16-2 against their respective opponents, and all were up by 2-0 margins except for the Oklahoma City Thunder, who inexplicably choked away a home game against the Mavericks but still went on to win the series easily.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">On the NHL side, it was a much different story. Three of the top four ranked teams, by odds, were eliminated in the first round (Los Angeles, Chicago, and Anaheim). As of last night, all four of these teams are now eliminated, as the Washington Capitals were eliminated from Cup contention with their Game 6 loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins. Unlike the NBA playoffs, the first two rounds of the NHL playoffs have had a tangible impact on who will take home the Cup in June.</p></div>
				
				<img src="may-nba-article-images/ovechkin.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a href="http://cdn-s3.si.com/s3fs-public/styles/si_gallery_slide/public/2016/01/27/alex-ovechkin-out-all-star-game.jpg?itok=-0zDkxsZ" target="_blank">WWW.SI.COM</a></p>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Another way to look at this phenomenon is through the role of potential finals matchups in each respective sport. When the playoffs began, the most likely Stanley Cup Finals matchup was Capitals v. Kings, according to betting odds. The Capitals were the Eastern Conference favorite, and the Kings were the Western Conference favorite. Since the playoffs began on April 13th, this favored matchup has changed five different times.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">On Friday, April 22nd, the San Jose Sharks eliminated the Kings, making the Blackhawks the new Western Conference favorite. Then, on Monday, April 25th, the St. Louis Blues eliminated the Blackhawks in Game 7, making the Anaheim Ducks the new favorite out of the West. Just two days later, Anaheim was eliminated by the Nashville Predators in another Game 7, installing the Dallas Stars as the new Western favorite. You read that right: in the span of just six days, four different teams held the title of Western conference favorite. It is important to note that a fifth team may hold this title at the end of this evening, as the Stars face an elimination game against the Blues.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">On the Eastern conference side, the title of favorite has been less chaotic, but has still been fairly dynamic. At the outset of the playoffs, the Washington Capitals were the President’s Trophy winners after posting a 120-point season, one of the most prolific in recent NHL history. While they were able to keep their status as the Eastern and overall Stanley Cup favorite through the first round, the Penguins eliminated them in the second round last night. This means that the Penguins are now the Eastern favorite and the Stars are the overall tournament favorite based on the previously mentioned odds.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In less than two rounds of play, the most likely Stanley Cup Final matchup has changed five separate times and both conference favorites have been eliminated. This has made for a month of must-watch action that couldn’t be missed by even casual hockey fans like myself.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The NBA is a vastly different story. Honestly, even the most fervent NBA fans, like myself, could have entered into a state of hibernation for the past four weeks and missed almost nothing important. I would love to take you on another journey through the topsy-turvy role of the favorite as I did with the NHL—I enjoyed writing that timeline and re-living all of the action—however, I don’t need to do that with the NBA.</p></div>

				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a href="http://www.wvgazettemail.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20150617/ARTICLE/150619406/AR/0/AR-150619406.jpg&imageVersion=SoftCropArticlePictures" target="_blank">WWW.WVGAZETTEMAIL.COM</a></p>	
							
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Instead, I can present it in two short sentences. When the NBA playoffs began on April 16th, the most favored matchup was Cavaliers v. Warriors. As I am writing this on May 11th, the most favored matchup is… you guessed it, Cavaliers v. Warriors.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The thing is, my qualm with the NBA playoffs isn’t necessarily that the most favored matchup hasn’t changed at all. It’s that this matchup hasn’t even been in doubt at all. Not for a single second. The Cavaliers have absolutely destroyed their competition, posting two straight sweeps despite playing uninspired defense (who can blame them when it’s this easy?).</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">On the other side of the bracket, the Warriors have had to face some adversity with Stephen Curry’s injury, right? Well, I guess that last sentence would rely on your definition of “adversity.” If adversity is rolling over Dwight “Ready for Vacation” Howard in five games, and then beating the Portland “We’re a Second Round Playoff Team who Starts a Plumlee Brother” Trail Blazers, then I suppose that’s adversity. But honestly, Golden State’s odds as the favorite have never really been in doubt.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The NBA <a href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/how-to-fix-the-first-round-of-the-nba-playoffs/" target="_blank">has a serious problem</a> with the first few rounds of its postseason. The only effect that the first round has on the eventual champion comes in the form of potential catastrophic injuries. This year’s victims in that regard were the Los Angeles Clippers, as the team’s two main stars were lost for the season in a matter of minutes. And even in that case, the Clippers didn’t have much of a shot anyways, with estimated initial title odds of 3% and a murderer’s row of Golden State, San Antonio, and Cleveland lurking ahead.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Hopefully, the NBA playoffs will improve in quality as they progress. Perhaps, we may even see the Cleveland-Golden State Finals matchup put in doubt. However, until that happens or the Finals come around (whichever comes first), I’m sticking with the NHL, and I urge you to as well. You may not know names like Carl Hagelin or Colin Wilson yet, but I guarantee they will inspire and entertain you more than watching Mr. “Ready for Vacation” in the early rounds of the NBA playoffs. As I said in the title of this article, and I’ll reiterate now, for the love of God, do yourself a favor and watch the NHL playoffs.</p></div>
