				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The first half of the NBA season has been defined by one major storyline: the success of the Golden State Warriors. At 33-2, the Warriors have set a new standard for regular season dominance. However, they have not set this standard by playing traditional basketball. Instead, the Warriors have redefined the way the game is played and turned conventional basketball wisdom on its head.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This is the team that passes up open layups for corner threes. It regularly plays a lineup that doesn’t contain a player over 6’7”. As a strategy, this style of play speaks for itself. The Warriors’ record is one that has never been achieved in the history of the NBA. Their success is undeniable. However, as a basketball traditionalist, I hate it. It drives me nuts. Watching this team play makes me cringe. Even analyst Mark Jackson has commented that Stephen Curry’s style of play is <a href="http://www.goldenstateofmind.com/2015/12/27/10670224/nba-2015-mark-jackson-quote-stephen-curry-hurt-the-game" target="_blank">ruining the game</a> for little kids because now they only want to shoot threes.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Excuse me while I briefly turn into an old curmudgeon. Growing up, I was taught the traditional way to play basketball. My dad, and many of the coaches I had, spoke about the dominance of the center in the old game. From Wilt Chamberlain to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to Hakeem Olajuwon, I was taught of the great post players that once dominated the game. I idolized Shaq as a young boy, wishing I could grow to half his size and dominate the post in my rec basketball league. However, with the dominance of the Warriors this year, and the ensuing evolution of the game that they have initiated, it seemed like my dreams of watching dominant frontcourt basketball had come to an end.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">That is, until I discovered my new favorite team to watch: the Detroit Pistons. At 19-16, the Pistons have drastically improved upon last year’s campaign and positioned themselves for the playoffs. They are exceptional to watch due to the way that they have blended new school ideas with old school frontcourt dominance. This team is truly built for today’s NBA, with an eye to the past. And let me tell you, it is wonderful to watch.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>The Dominance of Drummond</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Similar to the old school style mentioned above, it all starts with their center. Andre Drummond, now a legitimate MVP candidate, has improved steadily since he entered the league three years ago. His statistics speak for themselves. At 18.1 points and 16.0 rebounds per game, Drummond is the biggest double-double threat in the league on a nightly basis.</p></div>
				
				<div class="video_container"><iframe class="youtube_video" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ixkX1__-zqk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">While his uptick in points has been impressive (up 4.3 PPG from last year), his rebounding is what truly sets him apart from every other NBA center. He is currently first in the NBA in rebounding (16.0 per game), averaging 2.8 more rebounds than DeAndre Jordan, who is in second place.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">These simple rebounding statistics, impressive on their own, don’t tell the whole story of Drummond’s impact. If you examine offensive rebounds, Drummond himself averages 5.7 per game. This is first in the league by a wide margin. Andre’s offensive rebounding has created a substantial amount of new possessions for the Pistons. Ultimately, these possessions have led the Pistons to the most second chance points in the league (16.0 per game). In the end, basketball is about scoring more than the other team, and Andre Drummond’s rebounding has allowed the Pistons to score at an impressive rate.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Aside from simple statistics, Drummond’s style of play is very pleasing to watch. His unrelenting rebounding efforts show his dedication to the game on a nightly basis. These efforts lead to many put-backs that exhibit his exceptional strength and body control in the paint. He also complements those hustle plays with an improved post game. Currently, Drummond is seventh in the league in points scored in the post. This area will only see more improvement as he enters his prime over the next few seasons.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Inside Help</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Not only do the Pistons have one of the most promising centers in the league, but they have also surrounded him with a set of frontcourt players who can also hold their own. The most important of these players is Marcus Morris. At 14.3 points and 5.3 rebounds per game, Morris is one of the more formidable frontcourt options in the NBA. He even has some new school in him, as he can step out and shoot the occasional three (1.1 per game).</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Aside from the starters, the Pistons have added several bench frontcourt players that contribute as well. Forward Ersan Ilyasova adds 10.9 points and 4.9 rebounds per game off the bench. His midrange shooting gives the Pistons a nice change of pace from their more post-heavy options. Aron Baynes also provides support on the inside. A former Spur, Baynes’ presence adds much-needed playoff experience for this young team. The Pistons’ frontcourt is a force to be reckoned with as we move towards the playoffs for the 2015-16 NBA season.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>The Youthful Backcourt</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">While there is no doubt that the Pistons’ major strength is their inside game, they have a promising set of guards as well. Leading the way for this backcourt is Reggie Jackson. A new addition from Oklahoma City in the offseason, Jackson is leading the Pistons in scoring with 19.7 points per game. Jackson’s ability to slash to the basket has helped take the Pistons offense to new heights.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This slashing ability has also been valuable in other ways. Specifically, it has opened up opportunities for Jackson’s teammates to score. Jackson’s team-leading 6.4 assists per game illustrate his ability to find his teammates and put them in a great position to score.</p></div>
				
				<img src="jan-nba-article-images/reggie-jackson.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a href="http://www.detroitbadboys.com/2015/12/31/10696010/reggie-jackson-all-star-game" target="_blank">BRETT DAVIS-USA TODAY SPORTS & SB NATION</a></p>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Jackson’s fellow wing players have been able to take advantage of these opportunities. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, known for his superior athletic ability, continues to improve as his career progresses. His improvement has added a much-needed second scoring option in the backcourt for the Pistons (14.2 PPG). The Pistons’ backcourt, while not as prolific as its strong frontcourt, is a large part of the success the team’s enjoyed this season.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>What to Expect</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Because of their youthful core, Motor City seems to have a team built for the future in the Pistons. This team could definitely compete for a title within the next five years, given they make the right additions and stay healthy. However, just because this team appears to be set for the future does not mean that they will not be a factor <em>this</em> year.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Currently, this team sits in the eighth spot in the East. While they are on the playoff fringes, there is reason to be optimistic. Veteran guard Brandon Jennings recently returned from the Achilles tendon injury that had kept him out during these first few months of the season. While he is currently playing very limited minutes, Jennings’s contribution should increase tremendously as the season moves on.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Ultimately, I believe that Jennings’s presence will take this team to greater heights. With the rise of Andre Drummond, strong coaching from Stan Van Gundy, and a healthy Brandon Jennings, the Pistons will make the playoffs as the fifth seed in the East. Not bad for a team that sported an abysmal 32-50 record just last season.</p></div>
