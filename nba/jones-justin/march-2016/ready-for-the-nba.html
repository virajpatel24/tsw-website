				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This year’s NCAA tournament has been one of the most exciting of all time. With countless highlight plays and buzzer-beating finishes, basketball fans have been treated to four excellent days of basketball thus far. As an NBA writer, I wanted to delve deeper into some of the tournament’s best players and analyze their draft stocks. Here are four players worth watching as the tournament progresses.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Brice Johnson, University of North Carolina</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The most exciting player of the tournament thus far has been Brice Johnson of the University of North Carolina. A double-double machine during the regular season, Johnson has elevated his already stellar play during this year’s NCAA tournament.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In the Tar Heels’ opening round game against Florida Gulf Coast University, Johnson went off for 18 points, 7 rebounds, and 8 blocks. He was the dominant force that allowed UNC to pull away in the second half with a soul-sapping 25-6 run. His elevated level of play continued in the second round as he notched yet another double-double, leading the Tar Heels in scoring (21 points) and rebounding (10 points) in their 85-66 win over Providence.</p></div>
				
				<img src="mar-nba-article-images/bryce.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a href="https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j9Kb5_8-ksOBkBdimUKKGb8anC0=/0x141:2688x1653/1600x900/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/49111157/usa-today-9192811.0.jpg" target="_blank">WWW.TARHEELBLOG.COM</a></p>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">As a result of his tournament performances, among draft-eligible prospects, Johnson’s draft status has probably risen the most since the tournament began. The major question about Johnson since the beginning of his career at Carolina has been about his defensive intensity. While he has proven his talents as a rebounder this season, some questions about his on-ball defensive intensity have lingered.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">His performances in the tournament have gone a long way in ameliorating those doubts. His eight blocks against FGCU show Johnson’s commitment to protecting the rim. His massive block against Providence also provided one of the most notable highlights in the tournament. If scouts didn’t notice already, they have sure found it out in the NCAA tournament—Brice Johnson has the defensive intensity to be a high-level defender in the NBA. Expect many NBA organizations to find out that the Brice is Right as pre-draft preparations get under way. As for Johnson’s draft positioning? He’s likely to be a lottery or mid-first round pick, and will instantly provide a significant return for any franchise willing to bet on him.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Brandon Ingram, Duke University</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Now that we’ve discussed Johnson, we will take North Carolina 15-501 up to Duke University in Durham to discuss Duke’s most NBA-ready player. While much of the attention this season has been on Grayson Allen’s heroics (and <a href="http://www.si.com/college-basketball/2016/03/19/video-duke-grayson-allen-intentional-trip-yale-march-madness" target="_blank">occasional antics</a>), the true pro-ready talent is found in freshman guard Brandon Ingram. Averaging 17.1 points and 6.8 rebounds per game this season, Ingram’s season is among the greatest in Duke basketball history for a freshman.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Much like his rival across town in Chapel Hill, Ingram’s tournament performances have increased his draft stock. With 20 PTS and 9 REB against UNC-Wilmington, Ingram showed that he could be relied on as a rebounder, as well as a scorer. In the next round, Ingram reiterated his scoring prowess with 25 points. He also hit two clutch free throws to fend off a Yale run in the second half and cement the Duke victory.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In June’s draft, expect to see Ingram go as one of the first two picks. <a href="http://www.draftexpress.com/nba-mock-draft/2016/" target="_blank">Draft Express</a> was so convinced by Ingram’s tournament so far that they recently placed him ahead of consensus number one pick, Ben Simmons. While we will have to wait until May to see who goes first, Ingram’s NCAA tournament has created much more drama surrounding the number one pick, even though Duke was eliminated from the tournament last night by top-seeded Oregon.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Buddy Hield, University of Oklahoma</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The next player on the docket is my choice for Player of the Year: Oklahoma’s Buddy Hield. Hield has absolutely captivated the college basketball world this season, putting on a show while leading Oklahoma to its most successful season in recent memory. His 46-point, 8-rebound, and 7-assist performance at Kansas this season is arguably the best game that any player had this season (despite Oklahoma losing the game).</p></div>
				
				<div class="video_container"><iframe class="youtube_video" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/8uK4EwZfZ1s" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">While Hield hasn’t quite reached the level of that game during this year’s tournament, his stellar play has cemented his role as a lottery pick. Hield has posted 63 total points in Oklahoma’s first two tournament games. His 36 points and 7 rebounds were the catalyst in OU’s win over a tough VCU team in the second round.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">It was already known that Hield would be a lottery pick as we entered this year’s tournament. He is the most offensively advanced player in this year’s draft and can immediately make a difference through his scoring on any NBA team who picks him. His NCAA tournament has simply re-illustrated his talent, and may have propelled him a few spots within the lottery of the upcoming NBA Draft.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Diamond Stone, University of Maryland</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">While Johnson, Ingram, and Hield have been at the top of the college basketball headlines for most of this year, the fourth player on this list has received much less recognition. Diamond Stone, a blue-chip recruit from Milwaukee, signed onto a Maryland squad loaded with talent as a freshman. Despite the supreme level of talent on Maryland’s roster, Stone carved out a considerably large role for himself during his freshman season.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Averaging a stout 12.7 points and 5.4 rebounds per game, Stone’s post play was a major asset for the Terrapins in the regular season. His peak performance came early in conference play against Penn State. In this game, Stone scored 39 points and gathered 12 rebounds, leading the Terps to a comeback victory. Stone has put up very solid numbers since that game, keeping his draft stock in the mid-first round.</p></div>
				
				<img src="mar-nba-article-images/diamond.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a href="http://www.trbimg.com/img-568f1120/turbine/bal-diamond-stones-stay-at-maryland-could-last-longer-than-one-season-20160107" target="_blank">WWW.BALTIMORESUN.COM</a></p>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Despite a solid season, Stone’s numbers have slipped slightly during the NCAA tournament. Averaging 9 points and 3.5 rebounds per game, Stone hasn’t quite been the force that he was in the regular season due to foul trouble. Will this hurt his draft stock tremendously? No. Stone’s seven-foot frame and effective post game makes him an ideal mid-first round pick. However, if his play does not improve in the later rounds of the tournament, it is unlikely that his draft stock will increase. More importantly, for the success of his team, Stone will need to pick up his play in order to carry Maryland to the Final Four.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">These are four of the most important players to watch as we progress into the later rounds of the tournament. Each brings his own set of exciting elements to the game, and each is likely to make an impact in the NBA in the years to come. As the tournament continues, let’s hope that we continue to witness more enthralling games. And come May, let’s hope that NBA executives roll the dice on this edition of the Fantastic Four.</p></div>
