				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">As a stat-head millennial in the “big data” generation, I anxiously awaited the <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/fivethirtyeights-2015-16-nba-forecast/" target="_blank">2015-16 FiveThirtyEight NBA Preview</a>. With their quantitative breakdowns of each player and their holistic data-driven rankings of each team, these previews have everything that I could possibly want. While parsing through the rankings, I noticed some familiar trends: the Warriors are perched atop the West (as expected), the Cavaliers are out in front in the East, and the Knicks and 76ers have gathered near the bottom of the East. However, one of the rankings slightly jarred me. The Lakers are projected to be bottom-dwellers in a competitive Western Conference. After reading this, I looked to several other NBA Previews (<a href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/our-annual-tiers-of-the-nba/" target="_blank">including Grantland’s</a>) and found the same result.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">While I am not personally a fan of the Lakers, I have followed the team over the years due to the importance of Kobe Bryant and his place in the basketball history books. Despite your potential conclusions from the position I take in this article, I am not a naïve Lakers fan. I have simply examined the data surrounding the last place projection of the Lakers and drawn a different conclusion.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Why are the Lakers’ performance projections are so bad?</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Before delving into my personal argument regarding the Lakers’ 2015-16 season, it is important to note the reasoning behind their projections of futility.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">On a very simple level, the Lakers are predicted to be deplorable because the most relevant evidence that we have regarding their future performance paints a dismal picture. Over the past two seasons, the Lakers have compiled a record of 48 wins and 116 losses. Simply put, they have been abysmal during this period; there is absolutely no disputing that.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In the NBA, and especially in the Western Conference, there is a high level of continuity among playoff teams. Only 11 of the 16 Western Conference teams have occupied the conference’s eight playoff spots in the past three seasons. Teams like Sacramento and Minnesota have not even tasted the playoffs since 2006 and 2004, respectively. It is extremely difficult for previously bad Western teams to suddenly appear in the postseason. Given that the Lakers have finished second-to-last in the West for two straight seasons, it is understandable that they are projected to finish in a similar position this season.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">As I mentioned before, the majority of sports publications (as well as the public) seems to believe that these downward trends will hold for the Lakers. As Grantland’s Zach Lowe eloquently puts it, “[The Lakers] are like the lost camper who wanders blindly through the forest, accidentally drops a cigarette, burns the whole forest down, and sees their destination twinkling in the distance.”</p></div>
				
				<img src="nov-nba-article-images/kobe-shooting.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a href="https://www.facebook.com/losangeleslakers/photos/pb.144917055340.-2207520000.1446736861./10156191415950341/" target="_blank">LA LAKERS FACEBOOK PAGE</a></p>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">While Lowe’s metaphor of the Lakers’ futility is effective, FiveThirtyEight’s Baxter Holmes takes a more data-driven approach to describe why the Lakers will inevitably finish last this year. Using FiveThirtyEight’s real plus-minus projections, as well as their CARMELO player projection system, Holmes projects the Lakers to finish with a 27-55 record (worst in the West).</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">While the article presents an effective, data-centered argument throughout, some specific portions of it are especially notable. The most notable of these is found in Holmes’s discussion of Kobe Bryant. According to FiveThirtyEight’s projection model, Kobe Bryant is ranked “<a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/nba-los-angeles-lakers-preview/" target="_blank">as the 236th best player in the league</a>.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">On top of Kobe’s low ranking, the CARMELO model projects that young Lakers prospects Jordan Clarkson and Julius Randle will not greatly improve in their second year in the league. While Randle’s injury is used as the justification for his low projection, Clarkson’s low projection is justified by the fact that most of his stellar performances were during meaningless games last season.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Needless to say, both FiveThirtyEight and Grantland do not believe that the Lakers have a legitimate shot at the playoffs this season. Their justifications for placing the Lakers in the cellar are strong.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Kobe changes his style</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">All of those dour outlooks considered, I believe that the Lakers will still be a legitimate playoff threat for the 2015-16 season. While this may seem unlikely given their current expectations and performance, I believe that several important things will happen throughout the course of this season that will ultimately propel the Lakers into the playoffs.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The first of these important things is that Kobe Bryant will finally change his style of play and become more of a facilitator. All of the great ones have done this as they’ve aged, and I believe Kobe is no different. While Kobe’s “Mamba Mentality” and instincts lead him to be a shoot-first player, he will eventually come to the realization that he is better suited to lead this team in a different way.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In fact, he has taken this approach before. Last season, with a much worse supporting cast, Kobe was able to lead one of the worst Lakers teams ever to several upset wins in the middle of the season by taking on the facilitator role. In a game against the Raptors (the team with the best record in the East at the time), Kobe embraced this facilitator role and produced a stellar stat line of 31 points, 11 rebounds, and 12 assists. In another game against the Cavaliers last season, Kobe reached a career high for assists, recording 17 and keeping the Lakers in the game against one of the best teams in the league.</p></div>
				
				<div class="video_container"><iframe class="youtube_video" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/bAa2JkDP3DU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Kobe’s lethality as a facilitator put his opponents in a position that they can’t handle. As Raptors coach <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/losangeles/lakers/post/_/id/40513/kobe-the-facilitator-works-well-for-lakers" target="_blank">Dwane Casey noted</a>, “[Kobe] got a lot of people going and got them in a rhythm different from the way they've been playing.” When Kobe has taken on this role in the past, the Lakers have been very successful. On top of their success, this strategy has also been successful because it takes some of the scoring burden off of the Black Mamba and gives him time to rest.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">However, despite the past success and the apparent advantages, Kobe has been hesitant in taking on the facilitator role for an extended period. This appears to be due to a lack of trust in his past teammates. As <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/losangeles/lakers/post/_/id/40513/kobe-the-facilitator-works-well-for-lakers" target="_blank">ESPN writer Baxter Holmes reported last season</a>, “The cold truth is even if Bryant puts his teammates in position to score, it's on them to do so, and they haven't always done so this season. Many wide-open looks were not converted.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Clearly, Kobe has not had the necessary trust in his teammates to consistently use this strategy. However, that will change this season. Some key additions like center Roy Hibbert, as well as the development of the Lakers’ young supporting cast, will allow for Kobe to place more trust in his teammates and take on the facilitator role.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>The Lakers’ youth shows up</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">As I discussed above, most projections do not give much credit to the Lakers’ supporting cast around Kobe. I believe that these projections are highly misguided for several reasons.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The first reason is that the projections are highly underrating the Lakers’ youth. While first round pick D'Angelo Russell has gotten high ratings from most projections, the other young Lakers have been severely underrated.</p></div>

				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nba/photos/pb.8245623462.-2207520000.1446735282./10153394756648463/" target="_blank">NBA FACEBOOK PAGE</a></p>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The first reason is that the projections are highly underrating the Lakers’ youth. While first round pick D'Angelo Russell has gotten high ratings from most projections, the other young Lakers have been severely underrated.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">As ESPN commentator Hubie Brown put it during the first Lakers telecast this year, “Julius Randle was probably the Lakers best player during the preseason.” His teammates have also spoken highly of his play. Former all-star Roy Hibbert has called him, “<a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/nba-los-angeles-lakers-preview/" target="_blank">the future face of the NBA</a>.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">During the preseason, Randle’s numbers spoke for themselves. In just over 21 minutes per game, Randle averaged 11.1 points, 5.6 rebounds, and 2.4 assists. I fully expect Randle to carry this same success to the regular season. While it may take him a few weeks to adjust to the pace and the demands of a full NBA season, Julius Randle will be a huge contributor for this Lakers team.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Jordan Clarkson will also have a large impact on the Lakers’ success. The second-year guard was effective last year, and has already shown that he is ready to deeply improve upon last season’s output. Through four games, Clarkson is averaging 18.3 points on 55.8% shooting. In Tuesday’s game against the Nuggets, Clarkson posted a career-high 30 points. While most of Clarkson’s output from last season came during meaningless games, he is starting to show that he is ready to contribute in more meaningful situations this season.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>New additions have an immediate impact</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">On top of their youth playing well, the Lakers will also see increased production from their new additions this season. The most notable of these additions is seven-footer Roy Hibbert. Hibbert provides a force on the defensive end that the Lakers have not had since Dwight Howard hightailed it to Houston. While the big man is no Howard, his defensive presence forces offenses to alter their strategy away from attacking the rim.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Even more valuable than Hibbert’s general skill set and rim protection abilities is his experience. As a seven-year NBA veteran, Hibbert has the knowledge necessary to help Julius Randle navigate through his “first” NBA season. His status as a veteran will prove invaluable in guiding this young Lakers team to heights it hasn’t seen recently.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Guard Lou Williams is also shaping up to be a large contributor this season. Acquired this offseason, Williams has added new depth to the Lakers’ backcourt. Through four games, Williams is averaging 16.5 points per game. By giving the Lakers some much needed scoring help, Williams will help this team greatly.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Overall assessment of the Lakers’ 2015-2016 chances</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Through four games of this young 2015-16 season, the Lakers have failed to notch a win. However, this type of performance was expected given the fact that they are relying on so many new pieces. As the season continues and this team begins to develop some chemistry, they will defy their tempered expectations.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">They will shatter these expectations due to the contributions of their new pieces and underrated youth. As his supporting cast contributes more, Kobe will trust them more and take on more of a facilitator role as a result. The combination of these factors will make for a very exciting NBA season in Los Angeles.</p></div>
