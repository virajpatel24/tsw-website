				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Growing up I was never an NBA fan. I rarely followed the action and I almost never watched any games. My reason for this was, as I believed at the time, because “the players didn’t play any defense and everyone just cared about dunking.” Before you’re too hard on me for this, I fully admit that I was wrong. I was about 15 at the time, caring far more about trying to find my first girlfriend than whether or not my views on professional basketball were accurate. I’d like to think I’ve come a long way since then, and in the last two years, so has my understanding of NBA basketball.</p></div>
		
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Though I didn’t watch many NBA games, the few games I did watch always seemed to feature the Boston Celtics. This makes sense seeing as they were in the midst of the “Big Three” era and were usually one of the best teams in the NBA. I knew of Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, and Ray Allen from the hours of SportsCenter I watched daily, but the player that always stood out to me the most was former Celtics point guard Rajon Rondo. This diminutive, pass-first point guard seemed to quietly provide the passes and vision that allowed the Big Three to rack up the points.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Last Sunday upon returning to Boston with his current team, the Sacramento Kings, Rondo received a loud ovation from the Boston crowd. In an exciting and fast-paced game the Celtics took down the Kings 128-119. Despite the loss, Rondo played well and filled up the stat sheet, recording 14 points on 5-of-10 shooting, with 6 rebounds, 15 assists, and 6 steals. Watching Sunday’s game and the “Vintage Rondo” performance from Sacramento’s No. 9 brought back many of these old memories, and, eventually, it got me thinking about the trajectory of Rajon Rondo’s career.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“He’s the most interesting player I’ve ever known. How does someone who is 6’1” get 18 rebounds? How does someone who doesn’t run fast break get 20 assists? How does someone who never shoots get everybody open? We cannot begin to understand how he does it.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">- <a href="http://www.si.com/vault/2013/02/25/106289695/rondo" target="_blank">Brian Scalabrine</a>, Rondo’s former Boston Celtics teammate</p>
					
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Ask any player or coach that has ever dealt with Rondo and they’ll tell you just how intelligent he is and how well he knows the game of basketball. Danny Ainge, President of Celtics Basketball Operations <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2014/02/28/rajon-rondo-wrong-this-time/1ZajtNlGl8fkAoaxTq2i4O/story.html" target="_blank">has said of Rondo</a>, “He’s the smartest guy in the room and the most stubborn.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Doc Rivers, Rondo’s former Celtics coach, <a href="http://www.masslive.com/celtics/index.ssf/2013/07/boston_celtics_news_2013_doc_r_2.html" target="_blank">once said of his point guard</a>, “He knows as many of the opponent’s plays as the opponent does.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Lakers living legend Kobe Bryant <a href="http://sports.cbslocal.com/2015/04/23/da-for-a-smart-guy-rondo-looks-dumb/" target="_blank">has described Rondo as a hardwood savant</a>, “He knows all the plays, knows all the actions and can think two, three moves ahead. He’s freakishly smart.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Rondo’s current running mate Demarcus Cousins <a href="https://twitter.com/mr_jasonjones/status/648635046786547712" target="_blank">has proclaimed</a>, “Dude is a flat out genius when it comes to basketball.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">See a pattern here?</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But let’s not just take everyone’s word for it. Here are some more examples of Rondo’s extreme basketball intelligence.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In this clip, Rondo knows that pump faking quickly towards Garnett on the right will cause Pierce’s defender to hesitate and shift his weight away from Pierce. This gives Rondo just enough room to squeeze in a precise pass to Pierce for an easy basket in the paint.</p></div>
				
				<div class="video_container"><iframe class="youtube_video" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/VUXOQisu-Ts?start=30" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Here Rondo waits for Garnett to make his way towards the paint, which pulls Rondo’s defender away from him just enough to give him an open jump shot. Rondo pulls up for the shot, but instead of shooting the easy jumper he takes advantage of a sleeping Miami defense and passes to Garnett for the even easier open layup.</p></div>
				
				<div class="video_container"><iframe class="youtube_video" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/VUXOQisu-Ts?start=75" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">With only 1.9 seconds on the clock and his team up 3 points, Rondo was smart enough to realize the only basket that could hurt them was a 3 pointer. He then directed his teammates to leave the inside open and line up on the perimeter to make a 3-point attempt more difficult, resulting in the game ending without a shot even being attempted.</p></div>
				
				<div class="video_container"><iframe class="youtube_video" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/PnpQMUO-TUc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">With only 0.9 seconds left on the shot clock, there is very little chance of a basket being scored before the shot clock runs out. However, Rondo knows that a kicked ball results in the shot clock being reset to 14, and smartly throws the ball off the foot of the player defending the throw-in to force the shot clock reset.</p></div>
				
				<div class="video_container"><iframe class="youtube_video" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/bjS8oOxKkA8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Rajon Rondo is as close to a basketball genius as any player we have in the game right now. Basketball isn’t just a game for him, it’s an obsession. He isn’t satisfied until he knows every play that his team will run, as well as every play his opponent might run. And even then he’ll go through everything again. This intelligence, combined with the talent that Rondo so clearly possesses, should lead to an immense positive impact on every team he is a part of.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">So how did everything go so wrong in Dallas?</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">After spending eight and a half extremely successful seasons playing for the Boston Celtics, winning an NBA Championship in 2008 (and being selected as an All-Star on four occasions), Rondo was traded to the Dallas Mavericks as part of a package deal that sent Jae Crowder, Brandan Wright, and multiple future draft picks to Boston.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Due to his success with the Celtics, it came as a surprise when Rondo immediately struggled with the Mavericks. Rondo, a ball-dominant point guard who needs the ball in his hands to thrive, struggled to fit into the more balanced Mavericks offense. His per-game stats during his time with each team (shown below) reflect his struggles.</p></div>
				
				<img src="feb-nba-article-images/table-1.png" class="each_epl_image">
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Rondo’s strained relationship with Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle contributed greatly to his failed tenure in Dallas. Seemingly from the moment Rondo arrived, he and Carlisle butted heads. According to <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/2015/4/22/8467121/rajon-rondo-benched-dallas-mavericks-nba-free-agency" traget="_blank">Satchel Price of SB Nation</a>, Carlisle would often bench Rondo during the fourth quarter in favor of better shooters. Rondo’s frustration finally boiled over in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSeZmqmDuXI" target="_blank">an exchange with Carlisle</a> during the third quarter of a February regular season game. During the argument, according to <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/news/josh-smith-s-partnership-with-dwight-howard-flourishing-as-rajon-rondo-unravels-with-mavs-082337854.html" target="_blank">Adrian Wojnarowski of Yahoo! Sports</a>, teammates heard Rondo yell “Why the [bleep] did you bring me here?” The question, driven from a fit of Rajon’s rage, highlights Rondo’s frustrations with Carlisle; Carlisle knew of Rondo’s skill set and decided to bring him to the Maverick’s anyways, so why wasn’t he putting Rondo in a position to succeed?</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Strained relationships with coaches are nothing new to Rajon Rondo. Though he had a successful eight years with the Boston Celtics, he often did not see eye-to-eye with the coaches. One such occasion occurred <a href="http://www.sportingnews.com/nba-news/210661-reports-rondo-threw-bottle-through-video-screen-during-miami-series" target="_blank">during a film session</a> in which he throw a water bottle, shattering the TV screen, after having his errors pointed out by the assistant coaches. Another more widely known incident occurred between Rondo and head coach Doc Rivers, in which Rivers attempted to fight Rondo after Rondo <a href="http://www.si.com/si-wire/2013/06/22/doc-rivers-rajon-rondo-fight" target="_blank">reportedly cursed at him</a> during a locker room meeting.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Rondo is difficult to coach. He is a leader that refuses to be a follower, and that mindset has bred conflict with many of his coaches.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Regardless of who came out on top in the Rondo-Carlisle clashes, the fact remained that the Mavericks suffered whenever Rondo took the court. In an attempt to save team chemistry, Carlisle and the Mavericks used Rondo’s nagging back injury as an excuse to gracefully bench him after Game 2 of the playoff series against the Rockets. After the 2014-2015 season, Rondo was released by the Mavericks and became a free agent. The big question became whether or not anyone would take a chance on him.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Enter the Sacramento Kings.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">During this past offseason, the Kings signed Rondo to a one-year, $9.5 million deal, taking a chance and hoping that he would help provide the spark the team so desperately needed. Immediately, Rondo seemed like a different player, forming a strong bond with Kings center DeMarcus Cousins, and finally resembling his former self on the court. His per-game stats shot right back to his career averages. As of February, he is even leading the NBA in assists per game by almost two full assists. He is turning the ball over at a rate higher than he has throughout his career, but part of this can be attributed to the increase in usage he has experienced moving from Boston and Dallas to Sacramento, where he has taken on a slightly larger role in the offense.</p></div>
				
				<img src="feb-nba-article-images/table-2.png" class="each_epl_image">
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Rondo’s season has not been perfect, however. Once known as a very capable defender due to his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNooAC1FcGQ" target="_blank">quick hands</a> and intelligence, his defense has declined drastically over the last few years, beginning towards the end of his run with the Celtics. He even admitted, “<a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nba/eye-on-basketball/24931283/mavericks-rajon-rondo-i-havent-played-defense-in-a-couple-of-years" target="_blank">I haven’t played defense in a couple of years</a>.” Rondo’s defensive shortcomings are not due to a lack of defensive skill or IQ; they are purely a product of a decrease in effort. Choosing to go for steals rather than cover his man, he often leaves his man with a clear lane to the basket or open shot on a pick and roll. Spurring Rondo to increase his defensive effort and return to the high-level of defense he is capable of would be a godsend for the team’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOWtK98ggd0" target="_blank">overall defensive outlook</a>.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">As important as Rondo’s return to normalcy with the Kings has been, potentially even more important has been proving that he can still have a successful relationship with his coaches. After some initial reports that Rondo and George Karl, the Sacramento Kings head coach, did not see eye-to-eye, it has been smooth sailing between the two ever since. They have regular meetings, working on ways to improve the team, and, together, they continue to work their way up the rankings.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“I love him. It’s going to be a love, anger, contradicts, and right now he’s our motor. He makes us go; he makes us go in a very good way.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">- George Karl on Rondo, as reported by Jason Jones, <em><a href="http://www.sacbee.com/sports/nba/sacramento-kings/kings-blog/article50848765.html" target="_blank">The Sacramento Bee</a></em></p>
					
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">It seems that Rondo and Karl enjoy the challenge of working with one another; both acknowledging that their “wrestling matches” are more productive than disruptive. For the first time in years, Rondo and his coach seem to be getting along. With Kings management <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/14747006/sacramento-kings-retain-george-karl-coach" target="_blank">backing head coach George Karl</a> this week, after much speculation that he would be fired in the coming days, Rondo will likely have a coach he considers an ally rather than an enemy in his corner for the remainder of the season.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Though Rondo has been playing well the Kings are currently out of the playoff picture, sitting 5.5 games out of the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference. However, at times, they have shown glimpses of the high level of play they are capable of, and all hope is not lost if they can remain healthy and play together.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Rondo, an unrestricted free agent next offseason, has an important decision to make regarding his future. His play this year has teams around the league interested, and he will more than likely be offered multiple large deals and have his pick of teams to play for.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">One of these teams could, and should, be the Sacramento Kings.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Despite the Kings’ current record, Rondo has certainly had a positive impact on the team. He’s grown up a lot this year, taking on more responsibility in the locker room, helping him to finally start acting like the veteran he is. Rondo and Cousins have also formed a strong bond over the course of the season, with Cousins <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/sports/nba/sacramento-kings/kings-blog/article51640450.html" target="_blank">saying of Rondo</a>, “That’s my man. We talk a lot. There’s nothing we don’t talk about. It’s like we’ve been knowing each other for a while. There’s no other way to put it, that’s my guy.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Their bond is just as apparent on the court. Cousins is <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/sports/nba/sacramento-kings/kings-blog/article51640450.html" target="_blank">quoted as saying</a>, “This dude makes my job so much easier on a nightly basis. Throughout my career, this probably is the most easy baskets I’ve ever got.” Though it might not currently be showing in the Kings’ 21-31 record, a  strong bond between superstar players can be the recipe for success. If these two stick together after this season, then I’m willing to bet great things are headed for Sacramento. And if it’s up to Cousins, <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nba/eye-on-basketball/25397908/demarcus-cousins-says-rajon-rondo-will-re-sign-i-will-kidnap-him-myself" target="_blank">Rondo isn’t going anywhere</a>.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Regardless of where Rondo plays next season, a few things will not change. He’ll fit passes into lanes that only he can see, he’ll be a challenge for each and every coach to manage, and he’ll be the most diligent student of the game. In a game built upon the fundamentals, Rajon Rondo’s breathtaking magic on a basketball court, combined with his fiery attitude and brilliant mind, has the power to remind us, at times, of the passing skills of Magic, the finishing of Michael, the free throw shooting of Shaq, and the vision of Larry.</p></div>
