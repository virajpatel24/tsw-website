				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Do you have that one team that you just love to watch, but have no connection to whatsoever? And no, I’m not talking about the multitude of bandwagon fans who flock from one star-studded team to the next. I’m talking about following a team that doesn’t necessarily have a great record, but is absolutely exciting to watch. For me, that team is the 2015-16 Milwaukee Bucks.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">At face value, Milwaukee is not an exciting franchise. They haven’t done anything notable in 40 years, they’re located in the most boring part of the country, and their fans had the chance to name their franchise whatever they wanted but <a href="http://www.nba.com/bucks/history/logo" target="_blank">chose to name it after a deer</a>. Their team slogan is now “Fear the Deer.” Since when has anyone feared a deer?!?! Yawn.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But despite the less than daunting team name, the Milwaukee Bucks become far more interesting when you dig a little deeper. Their roster is littered with young talent primed for future stardom. From their <a href="https://twitter.com/Bucks/status/587774149038178304/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">recent rebrand</a> to having the second-youngest NBA roster, every aspect of their franchise is geared towards the exciting future ahead. For some franchises, like the Philadelphia 76ers, there exists an endless loop of young talent that will lead them to future success, but I don’t believe that will be the case with the Milwaukee Bucks.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Though they have regressed slightly from a 41-41 record last season to a sub .500 team this season, things don’t always go as planned for an up-and-coming group of players; especially with the shuffling of personnel they have endured over the last year. But if the core group of players sticks together and an important front office change is made, the Bucks have a real shot at contending in the near future. Here’s how they will do it.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>The NBA’s Most Talented Young Core</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Move over Lakers, the Bucks have this one locked up. With a starting lineup of Michael Carter-Williams (24), Khris Middleton (24), Giannis Antetokounmpo (21), Jabari Parker (20), and Greg Monroe (25), it’s not difficult to see where the potential lies.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">However, despite their youth, the Bucks do have a wide range of experience collectively. Some have played multiple seasons and discovered their role in the team, while some are still raw and trying to carve out their niche in the NBA.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Khris Middleton embodies the “experienced” young talent more than any other Bucks starter. One of the most underrated players in the NBA, Middleton has been a double-digit scorer for the last three seasons, but has really found his stride this season. He has upped his scoring average to 18.5 points/game while also averaging four rebounds and four assists.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Though Middleton is a very well-rounded scorer, he thrives from behind the three-point line. He has averaged better than 40% from downtown in each of the last three seasons, placing him among the league’s <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/statistics/player/_/stat/scoring-per-game/sort/threePointFieldGoalPct" target="_blank">best three-point shooters</a> and earning him a spot in this year’s Three-Point Contest in Toronto. The shot chart below helps illustrate just how deadly Middleton is from beyond the arc.</p></div>
				
				<img src="mar-nba-article-images/middleton-shot-chart.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">SHOT CHART BY <a href="http://www.austinclemens.com/shotcharts/" target="_blank">WWW.AUSTINCLEMENS.COM/SHOTCHARTS</a></p>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">His proficiency in this area is a godsend for a team that struggles mightily from three-point land. The Bucks currently average the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/statistics/team/_/stat/offense-per-game/sort/avgThreePointFieldGoalsMade" target="_blank">second-fewest made three-pointers per game</a>. Middleton gives them some much-needed spacing due to his range, preventing opposing teams from leaving the perimeter open in order to lock down the lane.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Middleton is not just a jump shooter, though. He is also a top defender, earning the second-best <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/year/2015/sort/DRPM/position/2" target="_blank">Defensive Real Plus-Minus</a> stat of any shooting guard during the 2014-2015 season. Though the Bucks have struggled mightily on defense this season, Middleton is the glue keeping them from completely crumbling on the defensive side of the ball. They are a far better team with him on the floor, as shown in the graphic below.</p></div>
				
				<img src="mar-nba-article-images/middleton-table-1.png" class="each_epl_image">
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Being one of only 15 players whose teams have been more than 10 points per 100 possessions better with them on the floor, it is clear the amount of value Middleton adds to the Milwaukee Bucks. And if he can continue hitting those jump shots, there will be no debate regarding his importance to Milwaukee’s success going forward.</p></div>
				
				<div class="video_container"><iframe class="youtube_video" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/qcmd7F5Eaz0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">On the opposite end of the spectrum is Jabari Parker. A raw, inexperienced talent out of Duke University, who still doesn’t know the style of game, or even position, he wants to play.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">As a 6’8” power forward, Parker has all the makings of a stretch four. But there’s one problem; he can’t shoot. He makes only 33% of his jump shots, with only three made three pointers on the season (20%).</p></div>
				
				<img src="mar-nba-article-images/jabari-table-1.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">CHART BY <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/parkeja01/shooting/2016/" target="_blank">WWW.BASKETBALL-REFERENCE.COM</a></p>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Parker’s shot chart tells the rest of the story. Parker is extremely talented at getting to and finishing at the rim, but his lack of mid-range or outside shooting ability makes this difficult. His speed and impressive moves are much less effective when the defenders do not respect his shot and can play off of him, guarding his path to the rim rather than playing tight defense in order to contest his shots.</p></div>
				
				<img src="mar-nba-article-images/jabari-shot-chart.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">SHOT CHART BY <a href="http://www.austinclemens.com/shotcharts/" target="_blank">WWW.AUSTINCLEMENS.COM/SHOTCHARTS</a></p>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But before judging Parker too harshly for his incomplete game, we must remember that he is essentially still a rookie. Parker is still finding his game after missing almost the entire 2014-2015 season due to a torn ACL. Despite his inexperience, he has had a very successful year by all accounts, seemingly finding another gear and <a href="http://stats.nba.com/player/#!/203953/stats/" target="_blank">averaging 21.6 points/game</a> in the last 11 games.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Jabari doesn’t need to know exactly what he is right now. Coming off major knee surgery at only 20 years old, there is plenty of time for him to re-develop the knock-down jump shot he had in his arsenal while playing at Duke. A solid mid-range game combined with nifty driving moves (<a href="https://streamable.com/ng3e?t=5.1" target="_blank">like these</a>) would be a nightmare for opposing defenders to contain.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>The “Greek Freak”</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Sitting atop the list of Milwaukee’s most talented players is Giannis “Greek Freak” Antetokounmpo.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">And what a freak of physical proportions he is.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Standing at 6’11” with a 7’4” wingspan and 12” hands from thumb to pinky, Giannis has, arguably, the most unbelievable body in the NBA. His freakishly long legs and achilles tendons that are <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/14927328/milwaukee-bucks-f-giannis-antetokounmpo-nba-most-exceptional-body" target="_blank">double the length of the average male’s</a> give him the explosiveness and acceleration to run the entire court in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfBTCNlbHAg" target="_blank">two dribbles</a>. TWO DRIBBLES. And without even really traveling! Or at least not what the NBA considers a travel.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Though he possesses those pool noodles he calls arms, he maintains the ball control that coaches salivate over, even running the point for the Bucks after starting point guard Michael Carter-Williams went down for the season.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">“Point Giannis” isn’t just some desperate solution head coach Jason Kidd cooked up out of <a href="https://youtu.be/vEqU7JHkfu0" target="_blank">“Hit Me” Land</a>, either. He has been an effective point guard for the Bucks, rebounding the ball and pushing up the court in transition often leading to finishes like this one.</p></div>
				
				<div style="width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.227%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/fkc6?muted=1&amp;logo=0&amp;hd=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen scrolling="no" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;"></iframe></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">“The Alphabet,” as he is known around the league due to his complicated last name, is arguably the most versatile player in the NBA. He is one of a select few players that maintains the skills and quickness to play point guard while being blessed with the size and strength to guard opposing centers, as he did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXntD89uAbs" target="_blank">against the Timberwolves</a> last week.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">He is a matchup nightmare at every position on the court. Smaller players don’t have the strength to keep him away from the rim, while larger players don’t have the quickness to stay with him as he flies down the court.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But Giannis isn’t perfect. Like his Greek counterpart Achilles, he does have one major flaw: his jump shot. Like many other Bucks players, Antetokounmpo struggles to score from outside the paint, as his shooting chart for the 2015-2016 season makes readily apparent.</p></div>
				
				<img src="mar-nba-article-images/greek-freak-shot-chart.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">SHOT CHART BY <a href="http://www.austinclemens.com/shotcharts/" target="_blank">WWW.AUSTINCLEMENS.COM/SHOTCHARTS</a></p>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Already an elite finisher at the rim, the Greek Freak is well below-average from outside the restricted area, shooting only 26% on jump shots and 22% on three-pointers.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In order to reach his full potential, Antetokounmpo needs to continue working on his jump shot, just like his running mate Jabari Parker. It doesn’t have to become his weapon of choice, but simply another tool in his belt. An improved jump shot would force defenders to stick tighter to him rather than sitting back and allowing him to shoot in order to guard the lane. Removing the cushion between Giannis and his defender allows him the opportunity to blow by that defender more easily and get to the rim as he loves to do.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In addition to being an elite scorer, Giannis is also a talented rebounder and passer. Fourth in the league with three triple-doubles so far this season, he is an extremely versatile player that can rack up both rebounds and assists. He also has the quickness and length to thrive on the defensive end of the floor. Though he is not the most menacing matchup for opposing players, he has shown glimpses of his defensive potential.</p></div>
				
				<div class="video_container"><iframe class="youtube_video" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/xaYw3xogtX4?start=134" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Here he recognizes the backdoor cut and shifts over to help defend, going straight up and using his length to block the shot.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">His game is exciting and his constant smile is infectious. I have no doubt that the Greek Freak will carry Milwaukee with him on his rise to superstardom.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Don’t Let Jason Kidd Play GM</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Though the Bucks have the young core to become a real contender in the near future, in order to reach their full potential, the Milwaukee Bucks will need to make a major change.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Jason Kidd, Milwaukee Bucks head coach, has taken on the de facto general manager role in addition to his head coaching position. He has largely been in charge of personnel, making some questionable decisions since he was hired as a head coach during the summer preceding the 2014-2015 season.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">These questionable decisions include trading veterans Zaza Pachulia and Jared Dudley during the summer after the 2014-2015 season. The Bucks were coming off of a 41-win season and a near upset of the Chicago Bulls in the first round of the playoffs. The squad finally looked primed for future success. But after the season Kidd immediately pushed to trade away the two veterans, who made up a sizeable part of their defensive core, largely in order to clear some cap space.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Despite Kidd’s forward focus, these trades were not good for the overall outlook of the team. The team’s defense has suffered immensely this season, with the Bucks bench unit <a href="http://www.hoopsstats.com/basketball/fantasy/nba/teamstats/16/7/diffeff/1-1" target="_blank">ranked dead last</a> among benches in defensive efficiency after ranking <a href="http://www.hoopsstats.com/basketball/fantasy/nba/teamstats/15/7/diffeff/1-1" target="_blank">fourth-best</a> last season. This is where trading Dudley and Pachulia in the offseason really hurts. Both are known as quality defenders, especially Dudley, who can comfortably guard multiple positions. Dudley and Pachulia would have helped shore up a porous Bucks bench unit, preventing opposing teams from scoring at will and keeping games closer while the starters get a breather.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">These weren’t the only questionable moves Kidd has spearheaded in his relatively short tenure as head coach and de facto GM. Arguably, the most surprising (a.k.a. ridiculous) move the Bucks have made was trading the 46th pick in the 2016 draft and a lottery-protected first round pick in the 2017 NBA draft for guard Greivis Vasquez. I understand Kidd’s logic in making the move as Vasquez is a quality three-point shooter that showed flashes of extreme potential during his stint in New Orleans. However, the Bucks severely overpaid for him. Vasquez, who has averaged a career 9.1 points/game, has not been the same player over the last four seasons, struggling to stay healthy and make more than a minor impact even when healthy. Even though he offers a much needed outside shooting element to the squad, in no universe is he more valuable than a lottery pick in next year’s draft, especially for a team that Kidd has specifically tailored towards future success. Kidd’s seemingly conflicting and questionable personnel decisions over the last season should raise concerns among Bucks management, who should lessen his role in personnel decisions.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Let me be clear, I’m not making this argument in order to say that Jason Kidd should be fired. In fact, I think that would be a poor decision for the future of the organization. A coach of the year contender for his role in Milwaukee’s success during the 2014-2015 season, it is clear he possesses the ability to coach. His focus on developing the organization’s younger players has been paramount to the success the Bucks have experienced so far.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In a season <a href="https://www.mangameslost.com/nba-games-missed-due-injury-march-6-2016/" target="_blank">plagued with injuries</a> to key role players, Kidd has planned around a distinct lack of shooting ability on his roster to engineer a successful offense. Kidd’s <a href="http://stats.nba.com/league/team/shots/#!/?sort=FG2A&dir=1&ShotDistRange=&GeneralRange=Less%20Than%2010%20ft" target="_blank">offensive scheme</a> perfectly suits the current strengths of his players. The Bucks have attempted the least three pointers in the NBA, while taking the second-most shot attempts inside 10 feet.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">And it has worked remarkably well, especially for the starters, who are averaging the <a href="http://www.hoopsstats.com/basketball/fantasy/nba/teamstats/16/6/pts/1-1" target="_blank">seventh-most points/game</a> of any NBA starting lineup.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Jason Kidd is growing as a coach right alongside his developing players, finding out his strengths, weaknesses, and what he can do to help the Bucks fulfill their enormous potential. If the Bucks can shift his focus away from personnel decisions, his coaching ability will continue to lead the Bucks down the path to success. And who knows, maybe the rest of the NBA will actually start to Fear the Deer.</p></div>
