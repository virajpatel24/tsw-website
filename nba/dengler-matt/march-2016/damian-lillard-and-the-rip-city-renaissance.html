				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>“The plan was never to tank. Damian and C.J. and three guys from ClubSport could win 20 games. There was never going to be any bottoming out; there was going to be development.”</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>- Neil Olshey, Blazers GM</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">With all the talk and hype surrounding the Warriors and their historic 2015-2016 season, you may have forgotten that other successful NBA teams actually exist, though you may not realize it from watching ESPN and their exclusive 24/7 Steph Curry/Warriors live-action coverage.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Joking aside, one NBA storyline that has gone underappreciated is the unbelievable 2015-2016 season the Portland Trail Blazers are enjoying. Portland is currently in seventh place in the Western Conference, with a 33-29 record. By all accounts, the Trail Blazers are well on their way to securing a postseason berth for the third consecutive season.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Someone may look at the Trail Blazers’ record and ask, “How can a 33-29 record possibly result in an ‘unbelievable’ season for <em>any</em> team, much less a team that had made the playoffs the previous two seasons?” While I understand your skepticism, fictional person, you haven’t let me explain myself yet. I’ll go ahead and do just that right now.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">First, let’s jump back to last summer. The Trail Blazers had entered the 2014-15 playoffs as the fourth seed, thanks to their sturdy 51-31 record in the regular season. Despite going on to immediately fall to a talented Memphis Grizzlies team in the first round of the playoffs, the Blazers had a great nucleus of talent to build around. The future looked bright for Portland.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Then, disaster struck. LaMarcus Aldridge, the Blazers’ best player and star power forward, decided to forgo a five-year max contract extension with the Blazers. He ended his free agency by signing with the championship-contending San Antonio Spurs. While this decision made sense for LaMarcus Aldridge, a veteran who was already approaching age 30 and probably wanted multiple chances to win a championship sooner rather than later, it <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/blazers/2015/07/04/why-lamarcus-aldridge-left-the-trail-blazers/29718151/" target="_blank">came as a major surprise</a> to the Portland management and fans. Only one year earlier Aldridge had <a href="https://twitter.com/blazerfreeman/status/486638261960331264" target="_blank">committed his future to the Trail Blazers</a>, claiming he was very happy with the direction the team was headed towards and that he was perpetually dedicated to being “the best Blazer. Ever.”</p></div>
				
				<img src="mar-nba-article-images/wes-and-ald.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a href="http://media.oregonlive.com/oregonian/photo/2015/07/28/-1d165e92b39d688e.JPG" target="_blank">WWW.MEDIA.OREGONLIVE.COM</a></p>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The looming release of Aldridge caused the Portland management to make moves they likely would not have otherwise made, fully igniting the transition from a budding championship contender to a team that would be lucky to see the playoffs anytime soon without Aldridge. One such move was the trade of talented forward Nicolas Batum to the Charlotte Hornets in exchange for Gerald Henderson and Noah Vonleh. Batum, a well-rounded swingman and seven-year Portland veteran, was released in order to cut cap space and start the rebuilding process in preparation for the Aldridge exit.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But Batum wasn’t the only key player to leave Portland last summer in the post-Aldridge era. Sharpshooter Wesley Matthews (who missed the last 27 games due to a ruptured Achilles), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYVT3QqHQiA" target="_blank">mascot-antagonizer</a> Robin Lopez, and Arron Afflalo also left the Trail Blazers during the summer of 2015. That’s 68.9 points/game worth of talent that just vanished from the team after the 2014-15 season. Poof!</p></div>
				
				<img src="mar-nba-article-images/table-1.png" class="each_epl_image">
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">68.9 POINTS. That's almost an entire game’s worth of points for the 76ers! But seriously, how can a team expect to replace almost 70 points per game that just disappeared in a single summer? Surely, due to the mass exodus of talent, the Blazers couldn’t be anything more than a bottom feeder hoping to begin rebuilding during the 2015-2016 season, right?</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Wrong.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Not only have the Blazers blown away expectations for their season, surpassing their Vegas projected win total of 26.5 wins after only 54 games, they have redefined what is possible for a “rebuilding” team to accomplish. Take notes, Philadelphia and Los Angeles.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">And make no mistake, this really was supposed to be a rebuilding season for Portland. And understandably so, given that the squad had lost a sizeable chunk of their overall talent. However, the funny thing is that it just hasn’t gone the way you might expect a rebuilding season to go (see 76ers and Lakers last couple seasons). Instead of a regular season full of Shaqtin’ A Fool candidates, the Blazers have somehow concocted a roster full of highly eligible bachelors (<a href="http://basketball.realgm.com/nba/transactions/composition_search" target="_blank">the team’s average age is 24.9</a>) who also know how to ball out.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Trail Blazers Head Coach Terry Stotts lost almost his entire starting lineup, and he has still managed to field a team that ranks seventh in overall offensive efficiency and eighth in points per game. Portland has accomplished this feat in a number of ways (including having a coach of the highest quality), but here are the three most important.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>1. Magical Guard Play</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Though the Blazers lost the majority of their scoring over the summer, they didn’t lose their most important player: Damian Lillard. Lillard is one of the best guards in the NBA, an electric marksman who is just as comfortable shooting the three as he is driving to the basket. Though he has been a top point guard for the last few years, he has raised his game to all new heights this season, shouldering the scoring load and averaging 25.4 points/game so far this season along with a cool 6.2 assists.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Lillard is an extremely well-rounded offensive player that can score from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAdt6nucn0" target="_blank">pretty much anywhere</a> on the court. When we compare Lillard’s shooting charts over the past two seasons, it becomes evident just how much shooting improvement he has undergone so far this season.</p></div>
				
				<img src="mar-nba-article-images/lillard-shot-chart.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">SHOT CHART BY <a href="http://www.austinclemens.com/shotcharts/" target="_blank">WWW.AUSTINCLEMENS.COM/SHOTCHARTS</a></p>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Despite being asked to take more shots each game, Lillard has actually improved his shooting this season. The most notable difference between Lillard’s shot charts is the improvement in his three-point shooting. Lillard improved from average to slightly-above average during the 2014-2015 season (34.3%). But this season, given his high volume of shots, he’s in the “well-above average” category from downtown (37.3%). He has also improved his midrange jumper, as evidenced by the emergence of the red dots near the top of the key. So, Damian Lillard has increased his shot volume this season AND become a <a href="http://insider.espn.go.com/nba/hollinger/statistics/_/position/pg" target="_blank">more efficient scorer</a>. Are you reading this James Harden?</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But Lillard hasn’t been alone in shouldering the scoring load for the Trail Blazers. His fellow backcourt-mate and great friend C.J. McCollum, former Lehigh University Mountain Hawk, has been a revelation this season averaging 20.9 points/game. And yes, that is the same C.J. McCollum of Lehigh University that knocked out Duke in the first round of the 2012 NCAA Tournament. In fact, he was the star of the team, <a href="http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/tournament/2012/story/_/id/7700207/cj-mccollum-leads-lehigh-mountain-hawks-shocker-duke-blue-devils-ncaa-tournament" target="_blank">scoring 30 points in their upset win</a> over second-seeded Duke.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Since then, McCollum has gone from a fringe rotation player during the 2014-2015 season to an integral part of the Blazers’ success this season, proving that he belongs among the top-tier of shooters in the NBA. As McCollum’s shot chart below illustrates, he thrives on the mid-range jumper, <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/mccolcj01/shooting/2016/" target="_blank">shooting just under 50%</a> from 10-16 feet from the basket. He is also <a href="http://stats.nba.com/league/player/#!/?sort=FG3_PCT&dir=1&CF=GP*G*30%7CMIN*G*20&Season=2015-16&SeasonType=Regular%20Season" target="_blank">one of the top 3-point shooters</a> in the NBA, shooting over 40% from beyond the arc.</p></div>
				
				<img src="mar-nba-article-images/mccollum-shot-chart.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">SHOT CHART BY <a href="http://www.austinclemens.com/shotcharts/" target="_blank">WWW.AUSTINCLEMENS.COM/SHOTCHARTS</a></p>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">McCollum’s weakness, as you can see in the shot chart, is finishing in the lane. However, it’s not quite as bad as the shot chart makes it seem (the calculations take into account the field goal percentage of big men as well as guards, increasing the overall average, which makes it tough on guards). And McCollum’s finishing deficiencies can be fixed. He has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=7&v=jyFTdUEIeyw" target="_blank">the handles needed to breeze past players</a> on his way to the rim, and as his confidence continues to surge, he should become more aggressive and comfortable attacking the rim with authority.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Lillard and McCollum feed off of each other's energy, slicing-and-dicing through defenses on their way to becoming the NBA’s second-highest scoring backcourt (behind the Splash Brothers in Golden State, of course). The dynamic duo keeps defenses honest, not allowing them to key in on any one player, which ostensibly opens up space for the rest of the team. The sky's the limit for these thrilling guards, and Portland will continue reaping the rewards of their improvement.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>2. The Coaching of Terry Stotts</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Though Lillard and McCollum have had career seasons, this has not happened by accident. Current <a href="https://twitter.com/trailblazers/status/704758347287830529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">NBA Head Coach of the Month</a>, Portland Head Coach Terry Stotts, has placed them in positions to succeed, while continuing to develop the players around them.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Much of Portland’s success this season has come from Stotts’ ability to successfully communicate with his players. His former colleague and Dallas Mavericks head coach, Rick Carlisle, <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/sports/oregonian/john_canzano/index.ssf/2016/02/canzano_terry_stotts_secret_sa.html" target="_blank">said of Stotts</a>: “His ability to communicate and adapt to his personnel make him a front runner for coach of the year. [He is] one of the top coaches in the NBA.” Blazers center Meyers Leonard also has high praise for his coach, saying, “He relates. He understands guys and communicates well. He cares about his guys.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The two areas Coach Stotts has focused on this season are improving overall defense and building team chemistry. While it’s clear communicating well with your players is a beneficial quality for a head coach to possess, it can only be so helpful. Coaches like Stotts have a complete understanding of the game, which is paramount to the success of a team full of youngsters that may not always make the correct decisions on the court. And Stotts’ team chemistry requirement starts with himself. The 58-year-old <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/blazers/index.ssf/2016/02/for_trail_blazers_late-game_misery_has_become_late.html#incart_river_index" target="_blank">only focuses on the things he can control</a>, putting everything else out of his mind.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The Blazers started the season in rough shape on the defensive side of the ball. Teams were torching them nightly for big numbers, largely on the pick-and-roll. Even though Portland was putting up plenty of points on offense they were losing games because their defense just couldn’t stop opposing offenses. But Stotts recognized this and made the necessary changes on defense, specifically on the team’s coverage of the pick-and-roll.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Zach Lowe of ESPN describes Stott’s mid-season defensive adjustments in <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/14877651/chemistry-commitment-blazers-ahead-schedule" target="_blank">an interesting article describing the Trail Blazers’ success this season</a>. In order to stop getting ravaged in the paint, Stotts made the decision to drop his big man back towards the paint on pick-and-rolls, adding extra rim-protection in an attempt to force teams to take more mid-range jump shots instead of attacking the rim. This adjustment has worked wonderfully, decreasing the number of opposition attempts around the rim as well as holding teams to <a href="http://stats.nba.com/league/team/defense/#!/lt6/?sort=LT_06_PCT&dir=-1" target="_blank">the second-lowest field goal percentage inside six feet (57.2%)</a>.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">However, as Zach Lowe also notes, “Stotts is quick to point out that none of this works without total buy-in from perimeter players. They have to bust their ass sliding around picks without falling too far behind and leaving their big man partner out to dry.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Stotts has succeeded in getting his players to buy into the system and work hard on defense, something far easier said than done for coaches in the modern NBA.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">A big reason for this success has been the team chemistry Stotts has helped to establish; a foundation of of the Blazers’ development this season. As Stotts said <a href="https://soundcloud.com/ripcitymornings" target="_blank">during a recent interview</a>, “I think our team chemistry is probably one of our biggest assets. We get along really well. A lot of young guys are really competing; they're playing together. Everybody understands their role.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Coach Stotts realized that when everyone has a chance to compete for playing time, they will play harder, which, in turn, will translate to increased effort on both sides of the ball. No one stands in the corner just waiting to receive a pass in Portland. Instead, everyone touches the ball in Stott’s free-flowing offense, passing around until they find the man with the best look at the basket.</p></div>
				
				<div class="video_container"><iframe class="youtube_video" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/O1sFQ_MiMDM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Long story short, Terry Stotts has the Blazers working together on both sides of the ball, making up for any lack of overall talent with drive, effort, and team chemistry. I have no doubt the Trail Blazers would be much farther down the rankings without the extra effort Stotts has coerced out of his players.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>3. The Leadership of Lillard and a Focus on Team Chemistry</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Think I’ve said enough about Damian Lillard so far? Think again. That’s how integral to this team’s success he has been.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Though his offensive contributions have been among the best in the league, his leadership skills have been just as important to Portland’s success this season.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Lillard has been doubted time and time again throughout his career. From the lack of interest he drew from college scouts during his high school basketball days, to “expert opinions” that his Portland Trail Blazers would finish dead last in the West, to his egregious all-star snub this season; there has been no shortage of doubt surrounding his game.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But Lillard doesn’t shy away from the doubt. He embraces it. The doubt fuels the fire inside him, pushing him to newer and greater heights as was evident in Big Game Dame’s one-man demolition of the Golden State Warriors shortly after his All-Star snub.</p></div>
				
				<div class="video_container"><iframe class="youtube_video" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/7IB5lEpASIc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This drive has shaped Damian Lillard into the team leader he is today. Lillard had always been a vocal presence in the Portland locker room, but with the departure of Aldridge, Batum, and Wes Matthews last summer, this was officially his team.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Lillard isn’t the type of leader to bark orders at his teammates during the game and chastise them after for their mistakes. He is a quiet leader, leading by example, and reinforcing the good things his teammates do while always pushing them to be better. From sit-down discussions with his teammates highlighting exactly what they can do to help the team, to supporting teammate and close friend C.J. McCollum by attending the All-Star weekend that he was so publicly snubbed from, Lillard leads with each and every action he takes.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“For me just being myself is being a good enough leader. I think it's not so much what you say goes or you always having something to say. Sometimes it's allowing somebody else to hold you accountable, saying something to you, Coach calling you out in film (session) and you taking the criticism without being salty or having an attitude about it.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">- Damian Lillard, as reported by Scoop Jackson of ESPN</p>
					
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The perfect example of Lillard’s leadership occurred last August during the offseason. Lillard <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/blazers/index.ssf/2015/09/damian_lillard_sends_a_message_a_dawning_of_a_new.html" target="_blank">sent a text</a> to the remaining members of the recently cleaned-out Portland roster, asking them to join him in San Diego in preparation for the upcoming season. Lillard knew the youth and inexperience the Blazers possessed, and wanted to get everyone together and on the same page before they started reporting to Portland in September. He knew this was his team now, and unless they understood where he was coming from and his desire to win, his style of leadership would not be effective.</p></div>

					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“You have to set the standard for how hard you work, and when you do that, you give yourself the right to say something to somebody else.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">- Damian Lillard, as reported by <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/blazers/index.ssf/2015/09/damian_lillard_sends_a_message_a_dawning_of_a_new.html" target="_blank"><em>Oregon Live</em></a></p>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">And boy did it work. The San Diego trip set the tone for the entire season, allowing the team to set their priorities for the year while bonding and building team chemistry. During a San Diego Padres game on the trip, Lillard emphasized that in order to be successful they had to play as a team. The individual success would come with the team success, but not before.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This message has clearly resonated with the players, who have bought into Lillard’s leadership and vision for the team. The Trail Blazers as a whole are greater than the sum of their individual parts; a feat only accomplished when chemistry is high and the players play for one another.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This exciting season has been a product of the commitment and belief of the coaches and players working together to move the Trail Blazers forward, combined with not-so-rare flashes of brilliance from Lillard and McCollum, Portland’s dynamic backcourt duo.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">While not a “historic” season from a numbers standpoint, the Blazers <a href="http://espn.go.com/chalk/story/_/id/13772067/nba-westgate-las-vegas-superbook-releases-2015-16-season-win-totals" target="_blank">have defied the odds</a>, the experts, and the conventional wisdom of rebuilding, to put together a truly remarkable season. And one thing is for sure; Damian Lillard will do everything in his power to prevent anyone from doubting him or his team ever again.</p></div>
