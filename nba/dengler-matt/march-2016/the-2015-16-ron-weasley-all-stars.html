				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Any sports fan knows how valuable Stephen Curry, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and the other superstars of the NBA are to their respective teams. Justifiably, most of the discussions seem to revolve around which superstar is the “most talented” and, as a result, the biggest asset to their team. But a far more intriguing conversation takes place when we examine the caliber of players that operate <em>outside</em> the superstar spotlight.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">There are quite a few players that offer significant contributions to their teams but don’t receive the recognition or attention of the higher-profile players in the league. I find these players to be created from the same mold as Ron Weasley from the <em>Harry Potter</em> series. Everyone knows about Harry Potter’s loyal sidekick and best friend. Throughout the books, Ron was always there for him, while never getting the credit or recognition he really deserved. Even in his own family, Ron was overshadowed by his high-achieving brothers. Although in the end Ron did end up with Hermione, so who’s the real winner now, Harry?</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Putting my thinly-veiled digs at the Boy Who Lived aside, these Ron Weasley-type NBA players are the Stickum that hold their respective teams together; the grease that allows the team’s gears to turn. And for the most part, their presence on the court puts the other stars of the team at ease, the same way that Ron Weasley balanced out the Harry-Ron-Hermione trio.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Here’s an in-depth look at three of my picks for the Ron Weasley (most underappreciated) All-Stars as the 2015-16 season winds down.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Ricky Rubio - Minnesota Timberwolves</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The Minnesota Timberwolves took a major gamble when they drafted Ricky Rubio with the fifth pick of the 2009 NBA Draft. An unproven 18-year-old Spaniard who planned to continue playing in Spain before coming to the NBA, Rubio was far from a sure thing. However, the Timberwolves believed they had found their point guard of the future and decided to roll the dice on the Steve Nash-like distributor.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">A quick side note here, because people should be aware of how badly former Timberwolves GM David Kahn butchered the 2009 NBA draft. In 2009, the Timberwolves, desperately needing to rebuild, possessed the fifth, sixth, and eighteenth picks in that summer’s draft. After the departure of superstar Kevin Garnett in 2007, the organization’s brain trust looked primed to finally build with a core of young players. But they blew it.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">After smartly drafting Rubio with the fifth pick, the Timberwolves followed that pick up with…another point guard, Jonny Flynn. But they weren’t done! With the eighteenth pick they selected Ty Lawson, YET ANOTHER POINT GUARD. They ended up sending Lawson to the Nuggets for a future first-round draft pick, which they used to select perennial seat-warmer Luke Babbitt. As if this wasn’t already bad enough, guess who Minnesota passed on in order to snag Jonny Flynn with the sixth pick?</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Stephen Wardell Curry.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">And yes, this was as boneheaded a move back then as it appears right now, as illustrated by Bill Simmons’s <a href="http://espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmons/090625" target="_blank">Running Diary</a> of the 2009 draft. So, Timberwolves fans everywhere, you can blame David Kahn for your team’s struggles over the last five years.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Though he doesn’t posses the skill set of reigning MVP Stephen Curry, Rubio is a player that often goes overlooked, largely due to his inability to score. He is among the very worst shooters in the NBA, shooting an abysmal 36.6% from the field and 31% on three-pointers throughout his career. And while he has worked to improve over the years, scoring just is not an area where Rubio shines.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The <a href="http://www.sportsgrid.com/media/shaq-thinks-ricky-rubio-is-italian/" target="_blank">“Italian Pete Maravich”</a> (apparently, Shaq doesn’t know the difference between Spain and Italy) is a magnificent distributor, able to squeeze passes into lanes that only he can see. He has the vision of Rajon Rondo with the flair of Barcelona’s Lionel Messi, performing highlight reels full of trick passes, like the ones below.</p></div>
				
				<div class="video_container"><iframe class="youtube_video" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/lcuzNAbqd_g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">He makes the game look too easy, commanding the floor with apparent nonchalance while setting up his teammates for open looks. As the T-Wolves acquire more offensive talent and as the Spaniard transitions to a secondary offensive option, his horrendous field goal percentage will matter less and the value he adds to the team through his phenomenal passing abilities will become more and more evident.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This transition has already begun. The Timberwolves are one of the most talented young teams in the NBA. The continued offensive improvement of Andrew Wiggins and Zach LaVine along with the addition of soon-to-be Rookie of the Year Karl-Anthony Towns has lessened the offensive load for Rubio, who is taking <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/rubiori01.html" target="_blank">2.5 less shots per game</a> than last season while dishing out more than 10 assists each night.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Rubio’s value isn’t just hypothetical, either; it is reflected in the stats. The Timberwolves are 11.3 points per 100 possessions better with the Spanish magician on the court, the 13th highest differential for any NBA player.</p></div>
				
				<img src="mar-nba-article-images/rubio-table-1.png" class="each_epl_image">
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">When you’re watching Andrew Wiggins and Karl-Anthony Towns dominate teams in the coming years, don’t forget about Ricky Rubio. He’ll be the unsung hero, slicing through defenses and providing the dimes for his talented teammates to finish.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>J.J. Redick - Los Angeles Clippers</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Everybody remembers J.J. Redick from his days at Duke University. Let’s be honest, if you weren’t a Duke fan you probably hated him for a reason you couldn’t quite put your finger on. He’s the pure-shooting “villain” that the whole country loved to hate. But apart from his yearly appearance in the Three-Point Contest during All-Star week, he has been largely forgotten by the casual basketball fan. However, after being traded to the Los Angeles Clippers in 2013 his career has trended upwards again.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Redick has taken on a feature role in the offense ever since Blake Griffin injured himself by punching a Clippers Equipment Manager named Matias Testi earlier in the season. In these Blake-less stretch of games, J.J. has increased his scoring output from 15.1 to 18 points per game. His knockdown shooting and high basketball IQ have helped the Clippers remain among the league’s best offenses as Griffin recuperates.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Despite having been a contributing factor in the Orlando Magic’s fairy tale 2009 NBA Finals appearance and being an integral part of an NBA finals contending team currently, Redick doesn’t get credit for being more than a role player by the average basketball fan. Redick is the best three-point shooter in the NBA this season, averaging an unbelievable 48.5%. Yes, you heard that right, he is in fact shooting a higher percentage from downtown than both Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson. As Redick’s shot chart below illustrates, he is phenomenal from <em>everywhere</em> behind the arc.</p></div>
				
				<img src="mar-nba-article-images/redick-shot-chart.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">SHOT CHART BY <a href="http://www.austinclemens.com/shotcharts/" target="_blank">WWW.AUSTINCLEMENS.COM/SHOTCHARTS</a></p>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Redick is one of the rare breed of players that is comfortable knocking down threes from <a href="http://stats.nba.com/player/#!/200755/tracking/shots/?p=jj-redick&Season=2015-16&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&sort=FG3_PCT&dir=1" target="_blank">catch-and-shoot attempts, as well as off the dribble</a>. Redick is dangerous whether he has the ball in his hands or is coming off of a DeAndre Jordan screen, keeping defenses honest and allowing him to get more open looks at the basket.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But Redick’s game is more than just three-pointers. This season he ranks sixth in the NBA in <a href="http://stats.nba.com/league/player/#!/shooting/?Season=2015-16&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&DistanceRange=By%20Zone&PerMode=Totals&CF=Mid-Range%20FGA*G*150&sort=Mid-Range%20FG%20PCT&dir=1" target="_blank">mid-range field goal percentage</a> at 47.9%, which was a shortcoming that he has worked hard to improve over the last few seasons. Redick’s improvement in this area forces defenses to respect his mid-range ability, which ultimately allows him to find a bit more space for his deadly treys.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Redick’s shooting ability paired with his basketball intelligence helps create the spacing necessary for the rest of the offense to thrive; and no one appreciates this more than Clippers head coach Doc Rivers. He has nothing but praise for Redick and the effort he brings on a nightly basis, <a href="http://www.si.com/si-wire/2013/10/29/donald-sterling-eric-bledsoe-trade-clippers-doc-rivers-jj-redick" target="_blank">stating earlier this season</a>, “I didn't even know that he was having a career year, I just know that he is being J.J. It's just who he is.” In 2013, Rivers even <a href="http://www.si.com/si-wire/2013/10/29/donald-sterling-eric-bledsoe-trade-clippers-doc-rivers-jj-redick" target="_blank">considered resigning</a> as Clippers head coach if former owner Donald Sterling had vetoed the Redick acquisition that Rivers had worked so hard to orchestrate.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In addition to being one of the most valuable players in the NBA, he is also a <a href="http://www.gq.com/story/hodinkees-watch-report-an-exclusive-look-at-jj-redicks-watch-collection" target="_blank">high-dollar watch collector</a>. And now he has become a successful <a href="https://art19.com/shows/vertical-jj-redick" target="_blank">podcast host</a>, with the added benefit of having an <a href="http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1481252/nba-players-favorite-music-iman-shumpert-jj-redick-corey-brewer" target="_blank">impeccable taste in music</a> (we share the same favorite band, Silversun Pickups). As a current UNC student it pains me to say this, but I think I actually like J.J. Redick.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Andrew Bogut - Golden State Warriors</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">When you think of the Golden State Warriors you think about Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green. Unless you’re a Warriors fan, Andrew Bogut probably doesn’t come to mind in most instances. But he should. Even though he isn’t one of the “Big Three” of the bay area, Bogut plays a vital role in the Warriors’s success each night.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">After a quick glance at the stat sheet you may wonder how Bogut plays such a large role on a scoring-assisting juggernaut like the Dubs. To be sure, he’s an afterthought on offense, averaging only 5.5 points per game while pulling down just over 7 rebounds in 21 minutes each night. Though he doesn’t play extended minutes or rack up points, the fact of the matter is that he doesn’t need to do so.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">His teammates Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green already take care of that. What Bogut offers is an extremely intelligent, physical inside presence that forces opponents to alter their shots. He is a phenomenal defender who belongs right alongside Rudy Gobert and Tim Duncan in the conversation for the league’s top defensive center.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Statistically, Bogut ranks fourth in the NBA with 3.9 blocks per 48 minutes. While this is an impressive statistic, some NBA centers are capable of blocking lots of shots without being exceptional defenders. Andrew Bogut is not one of them. In addition to blocking a high percentage of shots, Bogut is among the NBA’s finest at forcing opponents to change their shot whenever he’s patrolling the paint.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Opponents shoot <a href="http://stats.nba.com/vs/#!/opponent?TeamID=1610612744&VsPlayerID=101106&sort=FG_PCT&dir=1" target="_blank">3% worse</a> with Bogut on the floor. On any given night a 3% decrease in an opponent’s field goal percentage may not seem like a lot, but over the course of a season that is a MASSIVE amount of points saved by Bogut’s defensive presence on the court. And as the playoffs arrive, the Dubs will need the presence of both Bogut and Draymond in order to ensure that the Warriors’s high-scoring offense is not hindered by a lackadaisical defense.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Bogut has also earned the highest <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/sort/DRPM/position/9" target="_blank">Defensive Real Plus/Minus</a> statistic of any player in the NBA this season, an insane +5.99. To break this statistic down a bit further, this means that the Warriors give up 5.99 less points per 100 possessions when Andrew Bogut is on the court, the largest positive impact for any player in the NBA. It would not be farfetched to argue that Andrew Bogut is the most impactful defensive player in the NBA.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“Bogs is the middle linebacker. He's the one who's calling the signals and just anchoring everything, and protecting the rim when people do get the ball in the paint.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">—  <a href="http://www.nba.com/2015/news/features/steve_aschburner/03/31/andrew-bogut-fitting-into-complimentary-role-with-golden-state-warriors/" target="_blank">Steve Kerr</a>, Golden State Warriors Head Coach</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The phenomenal help defense in the clip below helps illustrate the type of defensive intelligence and quick thinking Bogut offers. He recognizes that Matt Barnes has beaten his teammate Harrison Barnes and has a clear path to the basket, and quickly takes up a perfect position to block his path. He firmly sets his feet and raises his hands straight up to prevent a foul, which forces Matt Barnes to abandon his drive to the basket and return to the perimeter.</p></div>
				
				<iframe src="https://vine.co/v/OeOXEOwT5wd/embed/simple" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe><script src="https://platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js"></script>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">While Bogut’s defense is his biggest asset to the Warriors, he is also a phenomenal passer, especially from the post. When Stephen Curry is not doing Stephen Curry things and pulling up from 30 feet to nail threes, the Warriors often run their offense through Bogut. Bogut is one of the best passers with his back to the basket, continually finding <a href="https://vine.co/search/bogut+assist" target="_blank">streaking teammates</a> for easy lay-ins.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Bogut’s ability to set up his teammates for easy shots is paramount to their offensive success. When receiving passes from Andrew Bogut, Stephen Curry shoots 57.4% (season average of 50.9%), Klay Thompson shoots 49.6% (season average of 47.1%), and Andre Iguodala shoots 57.9% (season average of 48.4%). These percentages are well above their season averages, and they illustrate the benefits offered by Bogut’s integral passing abilities.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">While he thrives with his back to the basket, he is also a dangerous passer in transition, often delivering inch-perfect full-court passes to a teammate tearing down the court. This clip perfectly sums up the phenomenal defensive and passing abilities that Bogut possesses. He recognizes a cutting Brook Lopez, locates the ball, and blocks the shot. After picking up the rebound, he surveys the court, and delivers a beautifully weighted chest pass for an easy Steph Curry layup at the other end of the court.</p></div>
				
				<div class="video_container"><iframe class="youtube_video" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/NldesvvDTlc?start=39" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Because Bogut only plays 21 minutes every night on the hardwood, he makes each minute count. The Warriors are 64-7 this season, and primed for the number one seed in the West. Thanks to their deep bench and stacked roster, they haven’t needed an aging Bogut to play 35 minutes a night in order to eke out that favorable playoff position. And in the playoffs, when each game is much more meaningful, Bogut will be well-rested and prepared to play as many minutes as they need him to play. And that’s when Bogut’s true value will become most apparent.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">So, when you’re watching the Splash Brothers rain down threes and Draymond Green run his mouth after every play, don’t forget about the silent giant hailing from the Land Down Under. Chances are, he’ll be the one finding teammates for open looks, and shutting down anyone who dares venture into the paint.</p></div>
