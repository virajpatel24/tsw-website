				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">It’s been a long time since anyone could say this with a straight face, but the Eastern Conference was better from top to bottom than the Western Conference this season. I know, I struggle to believe it too, especially after watching my favorite team (the Charlotte Hornets) play some terrible basketball over the last four seasons.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But the times have changed; the Hornets have revitalized their basketball program, a trend seemingly followed by the Eastern Conference as a whole. Though the West may have three of the four best teams in the NBA, the East was far more competitive. Heck, the three to six seeds were determined on the final day of the regular season, decided by head-to-head tiebreakers after FOUR teams tied with a record of 44-38.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The first round of these Eastern Conference playoffs should be as competitive as any first round in recent memory. Each team truly does have the potential to take down their opposition, even the Pistons, and I can’t wait to see which teams show the heart and the skill to move on to the second round.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b><u>No. 1 Cleveland Cavaliers vs. No. 8 Detroit Pistons</u></b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Series begins on:</b> Sunday, April 17, 2016 in Cleveland at 3:00 P.M.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Regular season head-to-head record:</b> The Pistons, surprisingly, won three out of four.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Prediction:</b> Cleveland wins in five games.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>No. 1 Cleveland Cavaliers, 57-25</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Overarching storyline:</b> Most people are looking past this series already, as most eyes are turned towards yet another potential Golden State - Cleveland NBA Finals matchup. While the Cavaliers should win this series, the Pistons won’t make it easy on them. They are a tough defensive team that will fight till the end. The Cavaliers better not look too far past this matchup or they may end up regretting it.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>One player to watch:</b> King James is on a mission this postseason. Stephen Curry will soon have won two consecutive MVP awards, and looks primed to win a second consecutive NBA Finals. It is safe to say that the sweet-shooting Steph has surpassed the <a href="https://twitter.com/KingJames/status/706508036421062656" target="_blank">sub-tweeting</a> Lebron James as the NBA’s current best player. But LeBron won’t concede this honor without a fight. He wants to win a championship for “The Land,” and I expect him to play like a man possessed during this series and the rest of the NBA playoffs.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Team health:</b> Good-closing-in-on-great. Only Mo Williams remains out due to injury for the Cavs.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>The mind-boggling stat:</b> LeBron James is 10-0 in first round playoff series, and his team has won 13 straight first round playoff games. It’s almost a fact: The man simply doesn’t lose in the first round.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Bandwagon potential:</b> Second only to the Warriors. We all know that any team Lebron plays for has the ultimate bandwagon potential, and if the Cavs make it to the NBA finals we may observe 2012 Miami Heat levels of bandwagoning.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>The coach factor:</b> The jury is still out on whether the midseason change from David Blatt to Tyronn Lue was the right move. From a record standpoint it does not seem that way, but from a visual and confidence perspective the Cavs look just as good, if not better than ever. This series, as well as the rest of their playoff run (if they make it past the Pistons), should shed some light on whether GM LeBron made the correct decision.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Difference maker off the bench:</b> Iman Shumpert has been officially cleared to play in Game 1, and I expect Shumpert to play a major role in this series. Defense, Shumpert’s specialty, is more valuable now that the playoffs have begun. I expect to see his minutes spike drastically, and would not be surprised to see him oust J.R. Smith from the starting lineup at some point later in the playoffs. From preliminary reports it looks likely the Cavs will attempt to bypass Kyrie Irving’s lack of defensive ability and stick Shumpert on Pistons point guard Reggie Jackson in an attempt to disrupt one of their top offensive weapons and throw their offense out of whack.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>They’ll lose this series if:</b> They look too far ahead. If the Cavaliers get complacent and overlook the PIstons, they could be in for a scare.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>No. 8 Detroit Pistons, 44-38</b></p></div>
							
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Overarching storyline:</b> Though the Pistons are an eight seed taking on a one seed, the Pistons won the regular season series against the Cavaliers three games to one. There is some hope that the feisty Pistons can replicate this success during the playoffs and pull off an upset for the ages.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>One player to watch:</b> Andre Drummond played in 81 games this season. He had double-doubles in 66 of those games. He is as dominant inside as any other player in the NBA. Though the Cavs are above average at guarding the paint, Drummond should have his way with them in a similar way to almost every other team he has faced. He is simply too physical to stop, and will need to have a monster series for the Pistons to contend with the Cavaliers.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Team health:</b> Good. Only Jodie Meeks and Spencer Dinwiddie are currently out with injuries.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>The mind-boggling stat:</b> 35.5%. That is Andre Drummond’s free throw percentage during the 2015-2016 regular season. Tell me why opposing teams don’t just foul him every time he touches the ball? You’re welcome, Coach Lue.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Bandwagon potential:</b> Low. Though full of talent, the Pistons are not a flashy team. Until they achieve much higher levels of success, the bandwagoners will stay away.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>The coach factor:</b> Stan Van Gundy is an experienced playoff coach. The Notorious S.V.G. <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2015/10/22/9599672/stan-van-gundy-inadvertently-made-the-best-rap-album-cover-weve-ever" target="_blank">(debut rap album pending)</a> became one of only two NBA coaches to defeat LeBron James in an Eastern Conference Semifinals series when his 2009 Orlando Magic team took down LeBron’s Cavaliers. That said, he will have to work some magic on this Pistons team for them to have a chance of taking down the Cavaliers.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Difference maker off the bench:</b> Though Aron Baynes will never be a dominant NBA center, he plays extremely valuable minutes for the Pistons. When opposing teams are employing the “Hack-a(n)-Andre” strategy on Drummond late in the fourth quarter, Baynes checks in and often closes out the last five or six minutes of games. Although not a domineering physical presence like starting center Andre Drummond, Baynes is no slouch himself. His tenure with the Spurs improved his defensive ability and toughness inside, and he is more than capable of shouldering both the offensive and defensive load late in the fourth quarter.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>They’ll win this series if:</b> They play like a team possessed. There is no denying the Pistons’ talent. Their core of Andre Drummond, Reggie Jackson, Tobias Harris, and Marcus Morris have sky-high potential. But this series is not their time to shine. Let’s give this core a few more seasons to gel. The Cavaliers are simply better and deeper at too many positions for the Pistons to compete over a full seven game series.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b><u>No. 2 Toronto Raptors vs. Indiana Pacers</u></b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Game 2 on:</b> Monday, April 18, 2016 in Toronto at 7:00 P.M.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Regular season head-to-head record:</b> The Raptors won three out of four.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Prediction:</b> Though they <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400874380" target="_blank">lost today</a>, Toronto will still win comfortably in five games.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>No. 2 Toronto Raptors, 56-26</b></p></div>
							
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Overarching storyline:</b> Much of the talk surrounding this series revolves around Toronto’s disaster during the first round of last year’s NBA playoffs when they were swept by the fifth-seeded Washington Wizards. Though this Raptors team has improved over the last year, earning the second playoff seed in the East, some still doubt their ability to make a deep run in the playoffs.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>One player to watch:</b> DeMarre Carroll could be the key to this series. If he can limit Pacers forward Paul George on the defensive side of the ball, the Pacers may have no other options on offense. But if DeMarre struggles to exploit George’s weaknesses, the Raptors may be in for a rough ride.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Team health:</b> Good, and recently improved with the return of the aforementioned DeMarre Carroll.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>The mind-boggling stat:</b> Kyle Lowry and Demar DeRozan are the third highest scoring backcourt duo in the NBA (44.7 points per game), trailing only the Splash Brothers and Portland’s duo of Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum. They accounted for nearly 44% of the Raptors’ total scoring this season. Feed these backcourt beasts, Toronto!</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Bandwagon potential:</b> The forecast predicts a bandwagon potential of low-to-medium. While all of Canada loves this team, it seems like whatever this talented Toronto team does, they just don’t get the bandwagon fans other winning teams seem to attract. Maybe it’s because they’re secluded in Canada?</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>The coach factor:</b> Dwane Casey is one of the better coaches in the NBA. Casey has grown and improved along with his team this season. He is a defensive-minded coach that has managed to pair an elite defense with an offense ranked top five in efficiency. The only worry is Casey’s lack of playoff success to this point (3-8 career record in the playoffs), which will be an interesting dynamic to monitor during this series.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Difference maker off the bench:</b> If DeMarre Carroll is on a minutes limit, as he likely will be in this series, the task of defending Paul George will fall to Patrick Patterson. Patterson is an elite defender in his own right, and has the potential to stifle George the way he clamped down on <a href="https://twitter.com/ZachLowe_NBA/status/703609714421211136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">Lebron James and Carmelo Anthony</a> earlier this season.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>They’ll lose this series if:</b> They are unable to limit Paul George. Everything points to the Raptors finishing off the Pacers sooner rather than later.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>No. 7 Indiana Pacers, 45-37</b></p></div>
							
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Overarching storyline:</b> This Indiana team is not unlike the Washington team that ousted Toronto in four games during last season’s NBA playoffs. Led by superstar Paul George and a talented supporting cast of George Hill, Monta Ellis, Ian Mahinmi, and Myles Turner, they have the potential to give Toronto a scare in the first round.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>One player to watch:</b> Paul George is the key to this series for the Pacers. The Raptors play elite team-defense, but George is as close to unguardable as any player in the game. He needs to completely take over this series for the Pacers to have a legitimate chance of playing the spoiler role for two-seed Toronto.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Team health:</b> No notable injuries.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>The mind-boggling stat:</b> During the 2013-2014 NBA season, Paul George averaged 21.7 points, 6.8 rebounds, and 3.5 assists per game. During the current 2014-2015 NBA season, one year removed from an absolutely brutal leg injury, Paul George has averaged 23.1 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game. Remarkably after a year-long recovery from a gruesome injury, George has become an even more dominant player.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Bandwagon potential:</b> Low. Apart from the underdog factor, I don’t see too many casual fans flocking to the Pacers during this series.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>The coach factor:</b> Frank Vogel is a talented coach with a solid postseason resume. He has extensive playoff experience, winning 28 of 54 games. Vogel’s playoff experience could prove invaluable, offering the Pacers a tactical advantage that Dwane Casey may not be able to match.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Difference maker off the bench:</b> Myles Turner, the athletic rookie who had an extremely successful rookie season, is more than capable of supplying a spark off the bench. He even broke into the starting five for a brief period mid-season. With his 7’4” wingspan, Turner is longer than any member of the Toronto frontcourt, and could provide an exploitable mismatch on the inside for the Pacers.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>They’ll win this series if:</b> Paul George puts the Pacers on his back and carries them into the next round. He must play lights-out for the Pacers to pull off the upset, something he is more than capable of. Even if Paul George goes ham, the Pacers will still require notable offensive contributions from players like George Hill and Monta Ellis to break down the elite Toronto Raptors defense.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b><u>No. 3 Miami Heat vs. No. 6 Charlotte Hornets</u></b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Series begins on:</b> Sunday, April 17, 2016 in Miami at 5:30 P.M.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Regular season head-to-head record:</b> Both teams split two games.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Prediction:</b> Miami wins after seven grueling games.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>No. 3 Miami Heat, 48-34</b></p></div>
							
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Overarching storyline:</b> Can the Heat overcome the unfortunate loss of Chris Bosh and defeat the upstart Hornets?</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>One player to watch:</b> Dwyane Wade. With more playoff experience than virtually the entire Charlotte Hornets team put together, Wade is the heart and soul of this Heat team. If Wade plays like the Wade of old, the Heat could make a deep run into the playoffs.</p></div>
				
				<img src="apr-nba-article-images/wade.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nba/photos/pb.8245623462.-2207520000.1460787161./10153936141563463/" target="_blank">NBA FACEBOOK ACCOUNT</a></p>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Team health:</b> Poor. The Heat have been relatively banged up all year, but the absence of Chris Bosh is the most notable injury. Chris Bosh has been out since February due to blood clots in his calf, and looks unlikely to play again this season.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>The mind-boggling stat:</b> Before the All-Star break Luol Deng was last on the Heat in plus/minus rating (-118). After the All-Star break, Deng led the Heat in total plus/minus rating <a href="https://twitter.com/manny_navarro/status/720714278009966593" target="_blank">(+144)</a>. My hunch is that this incredible turnaround was largely because of his move from small forward to power forward, due to Chris Bosh’s absence.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Bandwagon potential:</b> Massive. We all know “that guy” who will dust off his LeBron James Heat jersey, the only piece of Miami Heat apparel he owns, at the first sign of playoff success.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>The coach factor:</b> Erik Spoelstra. Make all the jokes you want about how Spoelstra never truly coached the Heat during their championship seasons with LeBron, but Spoelstra knows how to win during the playoffs. His experience could be the difference in what should be a tight series.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Difference maker off the bench:</b> Justise Winslow. As the season has progressed Winslow’s role has increased dramatically, despite the addition of veteran swingman Joe Johnson. Though not yet a major factor on offense, Winslow plays stifling defense and can shut down even the best offensive players. He will likely be tasked with guarding Nicolas Batum, one of the Hornets premiere offensive threats, and could play a major role in slowing down the up-tempo Hornets offense.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>They’ll lose this series if:</b> They simply get outplayed. Despite this being a three-six matchup, these two teams actually have the same regular season record. They also split the season series 2-2. The Heat and Hornets play completely opposite styles of basketball. The Hornets like to run the floor, while the Heat slow the tempo down and play stifling defense. The Hornets rank in the <a href="http://stats.nba.com/league/team/#!/?sort=FG3A&dir=1&Season=2015-16&SeasonType=Regular%20Season" target="_blank">top five</a> in terms of attempted threes, and the Heat rank in the bottom five. In effect, whichever team can dictate the tempo throughout the series has the best shot at advancing to the next round.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>No. 6 Charlotte Hornets, 48-34</b></p></div>
							
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Overarching storyline:</b> Can the young and hungry Hornets dictate the tempo and take down the veteran Heat?</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>One player to watch:</b> Kemba Walker. Walker has played like a man on a mission this season, improving in virtually every aspect of the game while leading the Hornets to a surprisingly successful 2015-2016 season. His pick-and-roll game has improved dramatically with the addition of a consistent three-point shot. Oh, and he is always capable of dropping 40 points on any given night. Every bit of his offensive prowess will be needed against the suffocating defense of the Heat.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Team health:</b> Moderate. The Hornets’ most notable injury is defensive-stopper Michael Kidd-Gilchrist. But most of the players do have niggling injuries that they’ll be forced to carry throughout the duration of their postseason run.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>The mind-boggling stat:</b> Charlotte ranks top-ten in both <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/hollinger/teamstats" target="_blank">offensive and <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/hollinger/teamstats/_/sort/defensiveEff" target="_blank">defensive</a> efficiency.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Bandwagon potential:</b> Low. However, if Jeremy Lin continues to make a major impact for the Hornets, expect fans of “Linsanity” to hop on the Charlotte bandwagon.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>The coach factor:</b> Steve Clifford has gained the league’s respect this season. He’s consistently regarded as one of the NBA’s premier coaches. In the offseason, the Hornets coaching staff made a conscious decision to abandon the defense-first mentality, and transitioned to a fast-paced offensive juggernaut that plays solid defense as well. It has worked wonders for the team, especially from behind the arc, where they rank top-five in three-pointers made per game.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Difference maker off the bench:</b> Don’t be fooled by his bench role, Al Jefferson is one of the Hornets’ best players. His matchup with Whiteside may seem tough on paper, but Whiteside struggles with physical centers like Big Al, especially ones that are able to stretch him away from the basket. This is right up Jefferson’s alley, and the matchup between the two centers could play a major role in determining who comes out on top.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>They’ll win this series if:</b> They outplay the Heat. As I mentioned earlier, these teams are far more even than their seeding indicates. Led by the electrifying Kemba Walker, swingman Nicolas Batum, and the hot-shooting Marvin Williams, the Hornets play fast-paced, entertaining basketball. They also have a talented bench unit that includes Jeremy Lin and Al Jefferson. The Hornets have been doubted all season; being the underdog suits them. I would be far from surprised (and, as a Hornets fan, incredibly happy) to see them take down this experienced Heat team.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>No. 4 Atlanta Hawks vs. No. 5 Boston Celtics</b></p></div>
					
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Series begins on:</b> Saturday, April 16, 2016 in Atlanta at 7:00 P.M.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Regular season head-to-head record:</b> Atlanta won three games out of four.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Prediction:</b> Atlanta manages to advance in seven games. Just barely, though.</p></div>
							
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>No. 4 Atlanta Hawks, 48-34</b></p></div>
							
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Overarching storyline:</b> These two teams play remarkably similar styles. Both squads play with a defense-first mindset and a competent offensive game. The Hawks had an extremely successful 2014-2015 season, but were swept by a far better Cleveland Cavaliers team in the Eastern Conference finals. This season has not gone quite as well for the Hawks, but with the same talented core of Paul Millsap, Al Horford, and Jeff Teague, the Hawks are hoping to make up for their less than stellar regular season with a deep playoff run.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>One player to watch:</b> Though the Celtics play great overall defense, they have struggled to contain physical inside presences, like the Hawks’ Paul Millsap. Millsap is a complete forward, just as comfortable taking a jumper from 12 feet as he is finding a cutting guard in the lane with a nifty pass. Millsap has had a career season, earning his spot <a href="https://twitter.com/Zach_Dillard/status/720642093736202240" target="_blank">among the greats</a> with his combination of points, rebounds, steals, and blocks. Millsap should have his way with the soft Boston frontcourt.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Team health:</b> No notable injuries.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>The mind-boggling stat:</b> Paul Millsap’s stat line in the Hawks’ game against Boston on April 9th: 31 points, 16 rebounds, 3 assists, 2 steals, 5 blocks, and 5/7 on three pointers. Unbelievable. More of the same, please.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Bandwagon potential:</b> Low-to-medium. Atlanta has had enough successful seasons recently to warrant a bandwagon fan base, but they never seem to get the same fan attention other successful franchises enjoy. But hey, if you ask Josh Smith, all of their fans are bandwagoners. So...there’s that!</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>The coach factor:</b> Mike Budenholzer is one of the premiere defensive minds in the NBA, which comes as no surprise due to his almost two-decade tenure as an assistant coach with the Spurs. Though questions remain about his offensive schemes, he is a veteran coach with ample playoffs experience that could prove vital against a relatively green Celtics team and head coach.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Difference maker off the bench:</b> Dennis Schröder, a speedy point guard from Braunschweig, Germany, may be the Hawks’ most underrated player. Though Schröder has backed up Jeff Teague at point guard all season, it would not be hard to make the case that he deserves a spot in the starting five. He provides the explosiveness often lacking among the current Hawks roster, running the court and increasing the tempo whenever he is on the floor. He will be in for a tough matchup with elite-defender Marcus Smart, but his quickness should give him enough of an edge to make a major impact off the bench.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>They’ll lose this series if:</b> They can’t contain Isaiah Thomas. Just like the Heat and the Hornets, the Hawks and Celtics were both 48-34 during the regular season. It is hard to imagine two more evenly matched teams, and two teams with more similar styles of play. The player most capable of taking over this series is Celtics’ point guard Isaiah Thomas. The Celtics’ offense runs through Thomas, and if the Hawks are able to cut off the head of the figurative snake, they have a great shot at advancing to the next round.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>No. 5 Boston Celtics, 48-34</b></p></div>
							
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Overarching storyline:</b> As mentioned above, these are two similar basketball teams with defense-first mentalities. On paper they are very difficult to separate, sporting remarkably similar offensive and defensive efficiency ratings. This one may come down to which team has the most heart, and has the potential to come down to a tight finish in game seven.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>One player to watch:</b> Isaiah Thomas is the 5’9” fireball who wants to win this series as much as, if not more than, any player on the court. He has had a career year, averaging 22.2 points and 6.2 assists per game during the regular season. Accordingly, he earned a well-deserved trip to his first All-Star game in Toronto earlier this year. The pint-sized guard seems to glide through defenses, contorting his body around the trees to finish at the rim. The Celtics will need every bit of his offensive creativity if they want to break the tough Hawks defense and move on to face the Cavaliers in the second round.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Team health:</b> No notable injuries.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>The mind-boggling stat:</b> The Celtics were 3-0 during the regular season when <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/4c73oa/oc_dumb_stat_of_the_day/" target="_blank">playing on a Celtics player’s birthday</a>, defeating the Kings, Trail Blazers, and Knicks. The Hawks better watch out when the Celtics come to Atlanta on April 19th, a day known to the free world as Kelly Olynyk’s birthday. Triple-double for Olynyk, anyone?</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Bandwagon potential:</b> Medium. The Celtics have long been a popular team to root for, but they did lose many of their bandwagon fans after the departure of their iconic Big Three. Now that the C’s are back and primed for a successful future, I’m betting a good number of those fans will return to the Boston ranks.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>The coach factor:</b> Is there a more likeable head coach in the NBA than Brad Stevens? Quietly going about his business, Stevens has transformed the Celtics from a lost puppy trying to find their way, to a talented group of players that play as a single unit. Stevens’ <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/dailyfix/2016/02/24/inside-a-brad-stevens-play/" target="_blank">basketball intelligence</a> and smart personnel decisions have prepared the Celtics for playoff success. The only question is whether that success will occur this year or down the road.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Difference maker off the bench:</b> Marcus Smart has come a long way from the player that was suspended for an altercation with a fan while at Oklahoma State. While his offensive skills still leave a lot to be desired, he is one of the true defensive leaders of the Celtics, alongside Avery Bradley. You would be hard-pressed to find a player who plays harder than Marcus Smart each and every minute he is on the floor. If Smart is able to shut down the talented Atlanta guards, the series could take on an entirely different shape, with the Celtics likely coming out victorious.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>They’ll win this series if:</b> Isaiah Thomas is able to continue his scoring rampage against the Hawks, and the Celtics are able to curtail Paul Millsap’s impact. Since the teams are so evenly matched, I believe this series will come down to the effectiveness of the best player on each team; Isaiah Thomas for the Celtics and Paul Millsap for the Hawks. If Thomas is able to have his way with Jeff Teague and the Hawks defense, this could be a long series for the Atlanta Hawks.</p></div>
