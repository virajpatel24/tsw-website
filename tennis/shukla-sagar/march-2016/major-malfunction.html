				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">I will be the first to admit, I have never been a “sports guy.” There were those long North Carolina afternoons during elementary school recess, when the kids in my class would don their Jake Delhomme jerseys and lob footballs across the playground, hoping that a Steve Smith would make a play and run it into the endzone. Meanwhile, I bided my time as King of the Hill on the foursquare court, absorbing the occasional stat that echoed across the football field. “Man! Did you see DeAngelo Williams make that 77 yard play against the Steelers last night?” Did he now… I’ll be sure to recite that back in 4th block English next time the topic of the day is running back efficiency! It did not get better in high school when I was hopelessly lost amidst the madness of bracketology, clear evidence that 10th graders could actually predict the future. Forget about passing pre-calc folks, putting money on Villanova crushing Butler in the Sweet 16 was the real deal. I memorized that one too, which helped boost my street cred when jockeying for a spot in the lunch line.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">As well as my façade of feigning interest in mainstream sports has served me in life, there has been one manifestation of athleticism that genuinely captivated me throughout my adolescence and into my adulthood: Watching two legends engage in a dance that consisted of striking each other within the confines of a four-sided ring. No, I’m not talking about Mayweather vs. Pacquiao. I’m talking about tennis. I’m talking about being enraptured by Nadal whipping his forehand crosscourt so hard, that he generated a spin never before seen in any subatomic particle. This is what converted my television screen into a shrine during four special fortnights of the year. This was the conduit for my conversion experience into “sport guy-hood.” As much as I rejoiced in ripping my one-hander down the line, it didn’t hold a candle to being in the presence of Gasquet at the French on Channel 217 (also known as Tennis Channel for all of you flubbing around with your remotes now).</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">A key to any sport is its image, the brand, values, and caliber to which it holds its athletes. I’d go as far to argue that this is <em>the</em> most important attribute -- without a strong brand, you will lose your loyal viewers, forsake your deep-pocketed sponsors, and uninspire a generation of greats who could take the game to a whole new level. The tennis brand, which so compelled me, is one of instinct, precision, and the balance of power between body and mind. It is hard to verbalize, or even visualize, how these words translate into a modus operandi. But when you see it, you just know.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Pete Sampras’s magnetic attraction to the net to punch a volley after a blistering serve. Justine Henin propping up her racquet head to cut a slice so fine that the ball doesn’t want to bounce back up. Jo-Wilfried Tsonga diving headfirst into the Wimbledon green to flick a dropshot into his opponent’s back court. These are not calculated plays, they are gut reactions, forged from years of identity and intuition building. Instinct has to be earned, not taught.</p></div>

				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="http://www.10sballs.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/h_513111711.jpg" target="_blank">WWW.10SBALLS.COM</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">I don’t think there is any sport in the world that has a higher referee to player ratio than tennis. Talk about precision. Eleven people officiating a two person match, including all the lines people, the infamous “Hawkeye” instant replay, AND a chair umpire? You cannot be serious! But they are, just ask a guy named John McEnroe. Being precise about everything from the size of the clay granules at Roland Garros, to how many millimeters the fuzz of the ball is away from the baseline is crucial to the sport’s DNA. Acute attention to detail makes great tournaments, and in turn makes greater players. Djokovic didn’t reach his dominance today without delicately tweaking and re-thinking each nuance of his game, except he had to do it better than Murray, Nadal, and Federer, probably three of the most refined players on the tour and definitely his top competitors.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Anyone would be remiss to not give Federer some ounce of attention when discussing tennis in the Open Era, and he is the pièce de résistance when it comes to aligning the body with the mind. Countless champions have fallen from grace after winning one or multiple grand slams. It is notoriously difficult to maintain the top spot in any sport, and even more so when pressure builds upon you to solidify your status as the greatest player to walk the Earth. However, Federer has maintained his composure throughout the intervening years, and has beyond flourished. He has dared himself to continuously improve, and most impressively, he has retained the highest level of integrity I’ve seen in any sport. Those who play the game know that your greatest opponent is not on the other side of the net, but the one upstairs. The one who has the hardest time walking the line between confidence and doubt, focus and fear.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">A sport’s brand is put on display upon its grandest stage: The four majors, Olympics, world tour championships. The giants of our age not only hoist up pineapple-tipped trophies after being crowned champion, they are the bearers of the world’s eyes and admiration. It has been a pleasure to live during the modern day golden age in tennis history, with all-time greats playing on both the men and women’s tours. No other time has the sport been so accessible to so many people, the brand unrelentingly strong and shining bright.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But a brand’s true test of legitimacy arrives when the world least expects it. And when it comes, it challenges the fundamental principles of the sport, doing so on the grandest stage.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In late January of this year, on the fairgrounds of the esteemed Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne, Australia, the tennis world was accused of widespread corruption at the highest levels of the game. A report from the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/35319202" target="_blank">BBC and BuzzFeed News</a> implicated 16 players in match-fixing, the act of accepting money to lose matches when the bets were stacked in their opponent’s favor. A few of these unnamed top-ranked players were thought to be prior grand slam champions, and supposedly this had been occurring under the nose of the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for over a decade.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Of course, these “facts” have yet to be substantiated, and even with all the finger-pointing, an official investigation to bring those perpetrators to light still has not been launched. Though no matter the outcome, the integrity and brand of the sport has undoubtedly been undermined. No sport is immune to an integrity infection, one that breaks down the fundamental premises of meritocratic competition with the shocks and scandals of illegal substances, bribery, and corruption. Though something about this one feels different. This feels bigger than a select few individuals who made questionable decisions. Tennis may not get its share of attention in the U.S., but it’s definitely receiving it abroad. When a major betting house <a href="http://event.ausopen.com/event-guide/partners/william-hill" target="_blank">becomes an official sponsor</a> of the Australian Open and <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-07/tennis-gamblers-demand-for-real-time-betting-nets-itf-data-deal" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> predicts that the tennis gambling industry is worth $5 billion and getting larger, there is a greater force at play.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">A gambling culture affects a sport like tennis in a profound way. For large organized sports such as baseball, doping or cheating rarely impact the entire team; usually it is a single individual desiring that incremental (unfair) edge over the others. I doubt you’ll ever hear of the entire New York Yankees squad being banned from the MLB, but the A-Rods or Barry Bonds of the sporting world will still exist. Furthermore, while the likelihood of winning or losing a single game will be impacted by the player’s actions, the team’s performance, as a whole, will ultimately determine the outcome.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">However, in tennis the likelihood of winning or losing a singles match is wholly dependent on the individual. That’s just the fundamental structure of the sport. You aren’t interacting with your coaches or compatriots during a tournament. And when a player accepts $50,000 to throw a match because there is $500,000 on the player across the net to win, not only is the integrity of the perpetrator destroyed, but the winning player would never know that the integrity of their win has also been compromised. Add up these one-off fixed matches over the course of a decade, and some disturbing trends can begin to emerge. Are the legends of our era actually great? Or were they crowned victor of a fixed match, a match that could have stopped a grand slam journey in its tracks? Without the data and an official investigation we can never know, but these philosophical questions are legitimate and the consequences are real.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">As beautiful as it is to watch instinct, precision and the balance between mind and body come together on the court, it is the intention behind them that ultimately produces quality. Accepting a significant sum of money to throw a match can be as natural as playing the game itself. To pull off the heist would also require calculated movements and cover-ups, from hitting one more double fault on game point, to preventing tennis officials from finding out. Finally, the mind can overcome the body in nefarious ways, deciding to forsake integrity and restrict effort in order to profit off of a match. There is a possibility the matches that provided a great inspiration to me and countless others had a pre-ordained outcome, thus tarnishing the brand I’ve come to know and love. However, a brand can also be tested through resiliency: the loyal viewers advocating against betting on matches, the deep-pocketed sponsors promoting sport over the free market, and a new generation of greats rising up to play for playing’s sake.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">My Amateur Tennis Viewer career (unofficially known as the ATV tour) has ebbed and flowed over the past few years. The strong start during the teen years that rocketed me to the epicenter of the tennis world tapered off when I went to college. It reached a point where I didn’t even realize that Nadal dropped out of the top 4, and that’s saying a lot for a guy who has a life size poster of the Spanish king himself. In an ironic twist of fate, it was actually the corruption accusations that kicked off the year that reignited my flame. I hadn’t watched an Australian Open with such intensity in years, and boy did it feel good. The scandal that can derail entire sports and relinquish millions of fans actually brought me closer to the game I love. Just like any relationship, time away from one another can be a very healthy thing. Once you overcome your differences and accept each other for who you are, being together never felt so good.</p></div>
