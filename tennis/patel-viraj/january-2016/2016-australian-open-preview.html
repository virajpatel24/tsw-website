				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Every year, the Australian Open manages to be the first tournament to capture the tennis world’s interest. Aside from being a new season’s first Grand Slam, the Land Down Under Open perpetually manages to provide some of the most exciting tennis matches, despite the everlasting, scorching heat. In their own way, each Grand Slam has its quirks that resonate with us long after the final match point has been played out. The U.S. Open has those roaring jets that are constantly flying over Arthur Ashe Court as the players fly around the blue hard courts. The French Open manages to couple the unparalleled feeling of clay court tennis with the undying spirit of the French people and their nation’s capital. Wimbledon? Well, the busy metropolis of London should be enough, but that tournament’s history outshines even that of its own city, at times.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The Australian Open? That unbearable heat. In fact, the heat wave became so extreme over the past few years that the Aussie Open’s organizers opted for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open_extreme_heat_policy" target="_blank">more lenient measures in match stoppages</a>. Margaret Court Arena even upgraded to a retractable roof ahead of the 2015 edition.</p></div>
				
				<div class="video_container"><iframe class="youtube_video" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Gz1egFjU5ng" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
							
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But whether or not the heat cools off over the next fortnight, we’ll still experience some exciting matches, per the usual high standards. The Australian Open has always delivered tight, unpredictable matches in its second week, but last year, some key upsets took place in the opening week. On the men’s side in 2015, wild-card entrant Thanasi Kokkinakis defeated the 11th-seeded Ernests Gulbis in the duo’s opening match. Living legend Roger Federer himself bowed out after his sudden 2nd round defeat to the unranked Italian Simone Bolelli. And Australian wunderkind Nick Kyrgios catapulted all the way to the quarterfinals before being derailed by Andy Murray.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">On the women’s side, the number one and two seeds — Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova, respectively — had relatively straight-forward paths to the final, which Williams won in two sets. While Serena and Maria ruled the roost, their colleagues had a much harder time of it. In her opening match of the 2015 Aussie Open, No. 15 Jelena Janković suffered a humbling defeat to an unranked Timea Bacsinszky. No. 8 ranked Caroline Wozniacki progressed past her first round opponent, but then fell quietly to Victoria Azarenka in the 2nd round. On a far more positive note, the U.S.’s two Madisons — Brengle and Keys — found their way to the fourth round, despite being unranked heading into Australia. Keys eventually wove past Venus Williams before losing to Serena in the semifinal match.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">If the 2015 Australian Open is anything to go by, then the 2016 edition should provide some mind-boggling performances in the early rounds before the action regresses to its compelling mean in the second week. Hence, here are the seven questions that have piqued my curiosity heading into this year’s Aussie Open.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>1. Will Rafael Nadal have his bounce-back year?</b></p></div>
		
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In 2015, Nadal reached the quarterfinals of the Australian Open, which coincidentally served as the apex of his season, given his cavalcade of niggling injuries and tough breaks the rest of the year. At his favorite tournament, the French Open, the Spaniard was ousted after the quarterfinals. And his Wimbledon and U.S. Open results aren’t worth repeating. As his outings disappointed, his world ranking predictably dropped from No. 3 to No. 5 as 2015 progressed.</p></div>
				
				<img src="jan-tennis-article-images/nadal.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/07/rafael-nadal-is-finished-wimbledon-loss-dustin-brown" target="_blank">USA TODAY</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Despite having earned a whopping $75.88 million from his tennis career thus far, Nadal only took home a paltry $3.94 million in 2015. His fellow superstar colleague Roger Federer took home $8.69 million, while the world’s best player, Novak Djokovic, outpaced them both with his $21.65 million in earnings. But when one has the career of a Rafael Nadal, money doesn’t carry much gravitas since there are more pressing matters at hand, like winning Grand Slams. This is why it came as a pleasant surprise to me when I read that both Nadal and Federer had not invested much time in cracking the Djoker jigsaw for the 2016 season.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“And yet, we must return to the answers given by Federer and Nadal in November, when asked whether they would dedicate their off-season to cracking this Mission Impossible. “Not really,” said Federer. “I know I will have chances with my game.” As for Nadal, he replied that “I never practice thinking about others. What Novak is doing is just amazing … but it’s not easy to stay at that high level.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Simon Briggs, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/novakdjokovic/12102647/Just-why-are-Roger-Federer-and-Rafael-Nadal-in-denial-over-the-brilliance-of-Novak-Djokovic.html" target="_blank"><em>The Telegraph</em></a></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Of course, figuring out Djokovic’s evolving game is no easy task and familiarizing themselves to the Djoker’s game still won’t help the aging duo march past the likes of Andy Murray, Stan Wawrinka, and Tomas Berdych, who all present varying challenges of their own. On the surface, it seems like both Nadal and Federer have undergone rigorous off-season training to ensure that they can survive and advance past any opponent. Unfortunately for them, even training can’t recreate the physical, mental, and emotional strains that Novak Djokovic places upon his every opponent nowadays. It certainly will be interesting to watch how two of tennis’s most famous stalwarts fend off their toughest opponent’s sheer dominance and brilliance as the 2016 season gets under way.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>2. Can Serena Williams build upon her stellar 2015?</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">For all intents and purposes, Serena Williams dominated the women’s game in 2015. Her <a href="http://www.si.com/sportsperson/2015/12/14/serena-williams-si-sportsperson-year" target="_blank">2015 Sportsperson of the Year honor from <em>Sports Illustrated</em></a> proved that her contributions to the tennis world and the sports universe did not go unnoticed. In 2015, Serena sported an astounding 53–3 record in her singles matches. And she even came within a whisker shy of bagging all four Grand Slams before her <a href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/serena-lost-serena-lost/" target="_blank">devastating semifinals loss to an unranked Roberta Vinci</a> in the U.S. Open ended that quest.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This year, the No. 1 ranked Serena Williams will turn 34 and, like her male colleague Roger Federer (who’s also 34), she’ll look to continue the upswing as her illustrious career approaches its final years. Speaking of that long career, her injuries have piled up over the years, too. While Serena’s aches and pains haven’t been as debilitating as those incurred by Rafa Nadal, they will still take their toll on her in 2016. Hopefully, those stints on the injury list will remain scarce since there’s still a few things left on her tennis to-do list, like catching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Grand_Slam_related_tennis_records#Women" target="_blank">Margaret Court’s record of 24 Grand Slam titles</a>.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>3. Does Novak Djokovic have enough left in the tank after a busy, but successful 2015?</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Yes. Next question.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>4. Will Federer’s Australian Open performance be an early indicator of his year?</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Roger Federer’s 2016 started off with the three essentials: A cold, a cough, and a new coach (Ivan Ljubičić). The Swiss Maestro has since recovered from the cough and the “<a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2016/01/16/tennis/roger-federer-australian-open-tennis/index.html" target="_blank">cold’s 90% gone</a>,” which means his chances of going far in the Aussie Open have significantly improved. After a barren 2015 —  as far as Grand Slams were concerned — the Fed Express seems primed to regain its bearings after a healthy 3–1 start to the year. Facing the 177th-ranked Nikoloz Basilashvili — who has never advanced past the third round in any Grand Slam — in the first round of the Australian Open should help Federer gain some more confidence.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But will winning a title in Melbourne to start off his 2016 really be a huge indicator of his year? Probably not. But last year, Fed’s performances improved as he progressed deeper into the year. After crashing out in the third round of the Aussie in 2015, Federer racked up a quarterfinals appearance at the French, as well as finals appearances at the U.S. Open and Wimbledon. So Roger’s fan base has no reason to lose hope should their leading man suffer through a listless outing in Melbourne.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>5. Can Nick Kyrgios tap into that home-field advantage?</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">While Rafael Nadal’s 2015 was shrouded in frustrations and disappointments stemming from his inability to stay healthy and perform consistently, 20-year-old Nick Kyrgios’s disappointing 2015 was a direct result of his <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/11802474/Nick-Kyrgios-and-Stan-Wawrinka-involved-in-locker-room-bust-up-after-girlfriend-slur.html" target="_blank">controversial on-the-court antics</a> and incessant pouting, which was on full display during his <a href="http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/09/nick-kyrgios-us-open-andy-murray-tweener-gif-video-nap-sleep" target="_blank">first round loss to Andy Murray</a> at the U.S. Open.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In 2015, Kyrgios went a meager 24–19 in his singles matches. Along the way, his frequent volatility and inability to focus meant we saw only small glimpses of his preternatural talents. In a way, Kyrgios reminds me of Novak Djokovic before the Serbian gained complete control over his mental fortitude and attitude. Novak’s rise began in 2010 and was fully completed during the 2011 U.S. Open when, on the verge of losing to Roger Federer, he pulled off <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azQemcdCwH4" target="_blank">an unprecedented come-from-behind victory</a>. From that point onwards, Djokovic’s outer rage transformed into inner strength, which, in turn, signified the creation of a completely different tennis player, a lean, mean machine hellbent upon winning 70+ tennis matches every year since 2011 (except in 2014, <a href="http://espn.go.com/tennis/player/results/_/id/296/year/2014/novak-djokovic" target="_blank">when he went 61–8</a>).</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">It will take Kyrgios a few more years to reach that state of zen that Novak reached in 2011, but once he does, Australians will have a true superstar to support once more.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>6. How will Lleyton Hewitt’s swan song Aussie Open unfold?</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Speaking of “true superstars,” Lleyton Hewitt is definitely deserving of that moniker. A two-time grand slam winner and a Davis Cup champion in 1999 and 2003, the former world No. 1 will ease into retirement after this year’s Australian Open. Wildly competitive and enormously talented, Hewitt took the ATP by a storm when he won the U.S. Open in 2001. He then followed that showing with a Wimbledon title in 2002. Thirty career titles later, the Adelaide native will step on those Melbourne hard courts for the final time.</p></div>
				
				<img src="jan-tennis-article-images/hewitt.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/1/29/1422522934610/Lleyton-Hewitt-009.jpg" target="_blank">THE GUARDIAN</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">His opponent in the first round will be fellow Aussie James Duckworth. If Hewitt ekes out a win against Duckworth, he’ll have the privilege of facing the tireless David Ferrer (current world No. 8). If Ferrer is conquered in the 2nd round, then the American John Isner will surely await him in the 4th round. From there, the climb towards that improbable third Grand Slam title only becomes tougher.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Realistically, Hewitt won’t be squeezing past the 2nd round, which is why I’ll be watching every second of his match against Duckworth on Tuesday.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>7. Which Americans will perform above expectations?</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">For the American men, John Isner seems to be the country’s best hope for a title contender. On the women’s side, no one’s derailing Serena on her quest to win her second straight Aussie Open title (and seventh overall). The two Madisons are back, too, with Madison Keys now ranked at No. 15. The young Sloane Stephens and the veteran Venus Williams will also be crafting deep runs.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Although he’ll have to face David Ferrer in the third round, No. 31 Steve Johnson will be in comfortable waters in the first four rounds and, <a href="http://espn.go.com/tennis/aus16/story/_/id/14575113/australian-open-2016-men-draw-presents-opportunity-rafael-nadal-nick-kyrgios" target="_blank">according to ESPN’s Peter Bodo</a>, the 26-year-old has the easiest path to the second week of matches. Since Andy Roddick’s departure from tennis in 2012, American men haven’t fared well in the four Grand Slams. And it seems that this year’s Australian Open won’t help buck that trend, either.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Apparently, the road to an Australian Open title goes through Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams. Many opponents — both young and old — will harness their energies in an attempt to bring down the two powerhouses. But as 2015 indicated numerous times, it’s incredibly difficult to win against people who never seem to lose.</p></div>
