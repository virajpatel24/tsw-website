				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>“God, Family, Football”</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In the 2013 movie, <em>The Best Man Holiday</em>, protagonist Harper Stewart (played by Taye Diggs) asks his friend Lance Sullivan (Morris Chestnut) what his three tenets of life are. As an NFL running back with a close family and strong commitment to faith, Sullivan’s line is what you might expect. “God, Family, Football.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">You may be asking yourself: “I thought I was reading a tennis article. Why am I reading about a below-average sequel to a classic romantic comedy?” Well, the answer is coming shortly. Don’t worry.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">I was recently re-watching <em>The Best Man Holiday</em> (I clearly have too much time on my hands), and this line delivered by Chestnut really struck a chord with me. I started thinking, “What would my three tenets be?”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">After deliberating upon this for a few minutes, I realized that this was too colossal of a question for someone of my youth. I can’t possibly define just <em>three</em> things that encompass everything life has to offer. However, I did my best to mirror my thoughts based on Lance’s line in the movie by starting with his original template.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">“God.” The first part of Lance’s tenets doesn’t really apply to me. I’m an agnostic (or an atheist - haven’t really decided yet), but either way, the concept of a higher power is not a central aspect of my life. So that part was out of the way. Next, I thought of “Family.” This tenet seemed perfectly suited for me—I am incredibly close with my family.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">I also thought of my friends. I have an extremely close group of friends from my high school, and we have remained close since then, despite going to many different places for college. Specifically, I am originally from Maryland, I went to undergrad at the University of North Carolina, and now I’m at the University of Michigan for grad school. I talk to each of these original friends on a weekly, if not daily basis. I have also been lucky to meet many excellent people during my past undergraduate, and current grad school, experiences. It made quite a lot of sense to have “Friends” as a one of my tenets (plus, it helped form a nifty alliteration for the title of this article).</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In the spirit of Lance’s third sports-themed tenet and my personal love of sports, I began to think of my third tenet, with sports in mind. After a few minutes of tracing back through some key moments in my life and their relation with sports, I came to an easy conclusion: Roger Federer. The career of Roger Federer has not only spanned almost my entire life, but it has also provided a special connection with my friends and family. In the lines that follow, I hope to share that connection with you.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Early Years</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Since my early childhood years coincided with Roger Federer’s early years of dominance, my memory remains a bit spotty about specific matches, points, scores, etc. Most of his early titles came while I was in elementary school and early middle school. I do remember watching some of the finals with my dad, which were always special, shared moments.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">I also remember the Federer-Roddick finals of that era, specifically because my mom would also watch them with us. She would always root for Roddick (she thought he was cute). I remember bragging to her about how Federer would always beat Roddick in the big moments. This trend would continue throughout their careers, and I was always the first to remind her of it. Roddick would even go on to make a classic remark about this at the end of one of their epic matches, <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/273137-hilarious-replies-and-one-liers" target="_blank">saying of his rivalry with Roger</a>, “I'm gonna have to start winning some of the matches to call it a rivalry."</p></div>

				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Federer-Australian-Open-Round-1-2016.jpg" target="_blank">WWW.PERFECT-TENNIS.COM</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">While my memory of this time is not the greatest, it is still of great importance to me because it was when I first fell in love with the game of tennis. Watching Federer win his first few championships made me want to be him and eventually led me to pursue playing the game of tennis later in life. Those early matches also helped form a tradition with my dad of watching the majors together, which continues to this day whenever possible.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>The Classic</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The first Federer match that comes to mind when I am thinking about specific matches and points is the 2009 Wimbledon Final against Andy Roddick. This was the greatest match of the rivalry by far, and is recognized as one of the greatest tennis matches of all time.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This match featured five close sets of tennis and was ultimately decided in the fifth set. Federer was able to make it to a fifth set by winning two tiebreakers, while Roddick had won both of the other sets by breaking Roger’s serve. Roddick seemingly had total control of the match due to the fact that a player cannot win by tiebreak in the fifth set. However, Roger ultimately prevailed in a tight 16-14 fifth set that lasted a jaw-dropping 95 minutes.</p></div>
				
				<div class="video_container"><iframe class="youtube_video" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/DFF1zbG3GY8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The match is specifically memorable for me because I got to watch it with my father. I will never forget how engaged we were with every point, both rooting for Roger. We were actually supposed to get up early go see Tiger Woods’ golf tournament in Washington D.C. that day, but when Roger advanced to the final, we made plans to watch the match first. Little did we know that the match would take nearly five hours to conclude.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">We ended up only getting to watch Tiger for a few hours (he won the tournament, so that was cool), but it was completely worth staying at home to watch the Federer-Roddick match. While writing this article, I messaged my dad and asked if he remembered the final point of that match. I immediately received a response: “Roddick was serving, Roddick was unable to return on his third hit.” I had to review the highlights, but he remembered it correctly, even after seven years. While I don’t have quite the memory that my dad does, I’ll never forget how special it was to share that day with him, watching two of our favorite athletes at the height of their primes.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Anxious Times</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The greatness of Federer has not only been there during the great times in my life, like during that auspicious Wimbledon final in 2009, but also in times of hardship. While I am not a person who believes that sports are powerful enough to cure ills or solve personal problems, I have found that they can sometimes provide comfort during anxious times.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">It just so happens that the career of Roger Federer has provided me with solace in some of my more difficult times. I’ve certainly led a fortunate life, so my issues may seem of little difficulty to some people. However, I have succeeded in overcoming some personal obstacles and I am proud of that.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">One of these major obstacles was going far away from home for college. When I was young, I was what you may call a “home body.” I didn’t like sleeping over at friends’ houses and would often call my parents to come pick me up in the middle of the night. I eventually grew out of this, but I was still very anxious about going to college because it meant that I would be far away from my home and my parents.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">I chose the University of North Carolina for my undergraduate education because of its beautiful campus and amazing academic opportunities. However, I knew that I would be isolated from home and, as a result, I was hesitant about leaving home for the foreseeable future.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">On July 8, 2012, it came time for me to start my journey as a Tar Heel. I was scheduled to leave that day for freshman orientation. Under normal circumstances, I would have been a mess. However, that same morning was the morning that Roger Federer defeated Andy Murray for his seventh Wimbledon title.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Watching the match and rooting for Federer kept my mind off of my anxiety. His grace in winning gave me a sense of euphoria heading into the weekend, and I was able to stay positive throughout the entire orientation. I met some of my closest friends during that weekend and I will never forget it. Watching Federer overcome his advanced age to win a title helped me overcome my anxiety of leaving home.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Another time when a big Federer match coincided with a hardship of mine was during the 2014 U.S. Open. In the quarterfinal, Federer was slated to play Gael Monfils. I talked about the match for the entire morning preceding it. I was very excited that Federer was playing at such a high level again.</p></div>
				
				<img src="jan-tennis-article-images/federer-tweener.png" class="epl_article_photo_features">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="https://rogerfedererfan.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/f_26aug14_5009_federer.jpg" target="_blank">WWW.ROGERFEDERERFAN.FILES.WORDPRESS.COM</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">However, during the middle of the day, I fell extremely ill. I ended up in the hospital because of the nausea and dizziness that had taken over my body. Despite my rough condition, I was still determined to watch the match. I was able to tune in via WatchESPN on my phone while receiving treatment. The entire match, I was so out of it that I didn’t realize I was no longer on UNC WiFi, and I racked up a sizeable mobile data bill as a result.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">That being said, the match was amazing. Federer fell down two sets early, as Monfils dictated the action. The Swiss Maestro was able to take the third set, but he was in trouble in the fourth. Down 15-40 on serve at 4-5, Federer was facing two match points. He was able to save both, and eventually won the match in five sets.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">While I have to credit the UNC Hospital staff for getting me back on my feet, there was no doubt that the Federer win put me in better spirits during that time of hardship. Worried about me, my parents actually drove from Maryland to North Carolina in the middle of the night to see how I was doing. When they burst through the door, they asked me how I was doing. Feeling much better, I had one thing to say in response, “Did you see the Fed match?”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Family and Friends</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Earlier this year, I moved to Michigan for graduate school. This was a bit of an anxious time for me, very similar to when I moved to North Carolina. I was definitely less nervous than before, but I still felt some tension as I once again packed my things and began a new life in a new place. On top of this initial anxiety, I was unable to move into my apartment right away because it wasn’t finished on time. I had to stay in a hotel for two weeks, far away from campus.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">It was during this time that I met my roommate, Connor, who was also staying in the hotel. During one of the first nights that we were hanging out, I turned on the U.S. Open. I asked him if he liked tennis. He replied that he didn’t really watch it and wasn’t very interested in it.</p></div>
							
				<img src="jan-tennis-article-images/federer-forehand.png" class="epl_article_photo_features">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EqQQCHlHBsI/T-shHQElQbI/AAAAAAAAALQ/uvvp2nHeM40/s1600/f_federer_05_24.jpg" target="_blank">WWW.BLOGSPOT.COM</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Over the next few days while we were hanging out, I continued to turn on the Open, especially when Federer was on. Each day, Connor became more engaged with what was going on as he asked me more about the rules and strategy. It only took a matter of days for him to get completely hooked. By the end of the tournament, Connor was yelling at the TV just as loud as I was during Federer’s matches. He’s now one of my best friends. We’ve already made plans to watch the Federer-Djokovic semi-final match together later tonight. I’ll never forget about how he and I first bonded over watching Federer together.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Not only has watching Federer helped me form new friendships, but it has also served as a reason to keep in touch with some of my closest friends who live in other places. My high school friend Joey and I text nearly every day during major tennis tournaments. He’s not a fan of Federer (we can forgive him, though, because he’s a good guy), so we have constant debates about how Federer is going to do in each tournament. I have had similar conversations with my other friend from high school, Kevin, who is a Federer fan.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Whenever we get the chance, Kevin and I try to watch Federer matches together. A time that specifically stands out in my mind is the 2014 Wimbledon final. My friends Kevin, Patrick, and Caitlin, as well as my parents and I, all gathered around the TV to watch the epic five-setter. While Federer did not win the match, it still meant a lot that that match brought all of us together for that period in time. This also reminds me of a hilarious moment during the match when Kevin proclaimed, “Djokovic is my favorite player but I’m rooting for Federer.” I can’t help but laugh every time I hear that statement, but I completely understand the notion. The beauty with which Federer plays the game can even turn fans of his opponent against their own player.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">It is these types of moments with friends and family that make Federer’s career so special to me. I think back to his 2014 Australian quarterfinal with Murray, when my friends and I invented the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=BuryMurray2014&src=typd" target="_blank">#BuryMurray2014</a>, and grin from ear-to-ear. I think of just the other night when I was out watching Spurs-Warriors with my friend James, and Federer-Berdych was running in the background. I think of the 2015 Wimbledon Final when I drove home to Maryland from North Carolina throughout the night, as a surprise, just to watch the final at 9am with my dad. All of these moments are special to me, and I have Federer’s brilliance to thank for that. Federer’s career is much more to me than just a collection of great tennis matches, it represents a connection that I have with the most special people in my life: my friends and family.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Federer’s Future</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">While Federer has not won a grand slam since that 2012 Wimbledon final against Murray, his play over the past few years has arguably been more exciting than his earlier years of dominance. What has been so enthralling about Federer’s performance during this time is his renewed chase of a title and new role as a slight underdog.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Save for his off year in 2013, Federer has come extremely close to another title on multiple occasions. Ultimately, he has faced one tough obstacle or another that has kept him from capturing a title in over three years. These obstacles have come in many different ways, most often in the form of world No. 1 Novak Djokovic’s inhuman play.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">And while sometimes it is easy to get frustrated as a Federer fan—he’s been so close on so many recent occasions—his inability to capture a title has made him even more satisfying to watch. Instead of assuming a title is coming, we now respect the challenge of trying to be at the pinnacle of one’s sport at an advanced age.</p></div>
				
				<img src="jan-tennis-article-images/federer-red-white.png" class="epl_article_photo_features">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="http://image.tsn.ua/media/images2/original/Jan2012/383554059.jpg" target="_blank">WWW.IMAGE.TSN.UA</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Federer’s chase of a title is like a drug. With every round, the effect increases as he inches toward the title. Every winner is intoxicating, getting us one point closer to the ultimate goal. Every tournament, we believe that “this is the one,” even though the experts keep reminding us that it might be his last chance. Inevitably, one of the aforementioned obstacles comes along, derails the Fed Express, and brings us back to Earth. We resort to the possibility that this might actually be his last chance. But it never really is. Federer’s excellence has us believing in him throughout each subsequent tournament.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Tonight’s semi-final match-up with Djokovic is a tough one. Some sources, <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/djokovic-and-federer-are-vying-to-be-the-greatest-of-all-time/" target="_blank">including Carl Bialik and Benjamin Morris of FiveThirtyEight</a>, have argued that Djokovic is playing at a level that we have never seen before. Even I picked Djokovic to win in my <a href="the-usual-suspects.html">mid-tournament predictions</a>. However, I won’t be too worried about the result tonight. I am just thankful that I get to watch Federer chase another championship. Maybe he’ll get another slam, and maybe he won’t. To me, whether he does or not is unimportant. The fact that he’s making us still believe he can do it is what matters the most and ultimately, it’s what keeps us watching.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This September, my dad and I have decided to attend the U.S. Open in the hopes of seeing Federer. Neither of us has been to an ATP event before, so this will be our first time seeing any of the top players. Because I consider my dad to be one of my best friends, it is the first time that my three tenets will come together in one place: “Family, Friends, Federer.”</p></div>
