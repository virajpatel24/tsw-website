				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">By the time the 2015 U.S. Open had concluded last September, I was already itching for the next major tennis tournament. The ATP Finals and other small events are certainly interesting to watch, but the real action ostensibly happens during the sport’s four majors. Last year’s U.S. Open brought many interesting storylines into the men’s tennis sphere. This year’s tournament in the Land Down Under has only furthered these storylines, without many major changes.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Nadal: Shocking Result or the New Normal?</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Rafael Nadal’s downward spiral is the most obvious of these continued storylines. After his early exit at the U.S. Open last season, Nadal showed signs of promise that his game was improving. He made the semifinals of the ATP Finals, and was able to raise his world ranking to No. 5 going into this year’s Australian Open.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This elevated ranking (he dropped to as low as No. 10 in 2015) had many thinking that Nadal would make a resurgence of sorts this season. Our own Viraj Patel highlighted this in mentioning Nadal’s “<a href="../../patel-viraj/january-2016/2016-australian-open-preview.html">rigorous off-season training</a>” in our Australian Open preview.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">However, Nadal’s comeback was not meant to be at the 2016 Australian Open. The Spaniard was ousted in the first round in a close five-set match against compatriot Fernando Verdasco. Verdasco’s powerful groundstrokes were on full display in this match, as he hit 90 total winners.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">While Verdasco’s excellent performance leads one to believe that Nadal’s game may not have been that bad at the Open, this narrative is quite simply untrue.  Nadal’s poor play and shoddy strategy helped set up Verdasco for an epic performance.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Nadal’s downfall came due to his weak play. He set up Verdasco with countless easy opportunities by placing the ball short in the middle of the court. Overall, his strength is not where it needs to be in order to properly contend at the highest level. This year’s Australian Open showed us just how far Nadal has to travel before he can truly return to his once-elite form.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Murray and Wawrinka: Steady Starts</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Along with Nadal, the other two stars on the bottom half of the draw are Andy Murray and Stan Wawrinka. Thus far, these two have had very similar experiences at the Aussie. Wawrinka has yet to drop a set, and Murray has had a relatively easy time as well, only dropping one set.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">While both players have had a relatively uneventful experience on the court so far, Murray has not been so lucky off the court. During his third round match, Murray’s father-in-law, Nigel Sears, collapsed and was rushed to a Melbourne hospital. Sears, the coach of Ana Ivanović, was eventually pronounced healthy and was allowed to leave for his home in the U.K. However, thoughts of both the fragile health of his father-in-law and the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/35333243" target="_blank">soon-to-be-arriving baby Murray</a> will no doubt permeate Andy Murray’s mind as the tournament progresses.</p></div>
				
				<img src="jan-tennis-article-images/murray.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="https://www.facebook.com/AustralianOpen/photos/pb.48160623614.-2207520000.1453694487./10153896364918615/" target="_blank">AUSTRALIAN OPEN FACEBOOK ACCOUNT</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">His focus will be put to the test in the next round when he faces off against the young, versatile Benard Tomic, who will have home-court advantage. While the young Australian has never taken a set from Murray in their three encounters, he is playing at his highest level right now. Wawrinka also has a difficult task on his hands against the 25-year-old Milos Raonic. Raonic has been playing his best tennis lately, defeating Roger Federer in the Aussie Open series tournament in Brisbane right before the Open began this week.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">It is important to note that Stan has been dealing with a minor illness causing him to lose his voice. However, his spirits do not seem to have declined as a result of this bug. When asked about <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2016/01/23/tennis/australian-open-tennis-wawrinka-azarenka-murray/" target="_blank">his illness and losing his voice</a>, Stan hilariously joked, “I don't really need my voice. If I can talk, I talk too much s***.”</p></div>
				
				<img src="jan-tennis-article-images/wawrinka.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="https://www.facebook.com/AustralianOpen/photos/pb.48160623614.-2207520000.1453694548./10153894069543615/" target="_blank">AUSTRALIAN OPEN FACEBOOK ACCOUNT</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Ultimately, I believe that both Murray and Wawrinka will dispatch their fourth round opponents without too much trouble, which will place the duo on a collision-course for a semifinal meeting. In that semifinal match-up, I’ll be backing Stan, who should triumph over Murray in four sets, because of the strength of his backhand against Murray’s strong service game. However, this success will be short-lived for Stan the Man, as he will ultimately lose to the winner of the stronger top half of the bracket, which features the Fed Express and the Djoker.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Djokovic and Federer: Surviving and Advancing</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Speaking of the Fed Express and the Djoker, while the top two stars in the bottom half of the draw (Murray and Wawrinka) have had it relatively easy, the same cannot be said for the superstars of the top half. Roger Federer has probably had the most difficult draw of the main contenders, facing tough outs in each of the past three rounds.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The most notable match of Federer’s Open was his clash with Grigor Dimitrov in the third round. Much better than his No. 27 ranking suggests, Dimitrov had Federer reeling for much of the middle portion of their match. After losing the first set 4-6, Grigor was able to take the second set off of Federer, with form that we haven’t seen since his successful 2014 season. However, the Swiss maestro ultimately prevailed in four sets, dominating both the third and fourth sets with amazing precision.</p></div>
				
				<img src="jan-tennis-article-images/djokovic.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="https://www.facebook.com/AustralianOpen/photos/pb.48160623614.-2207520000.1453694402./10153898648293615/" target="_blank">AUSTRALIAN OPEN FACEBOOK ACCOUNT</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">World No. 1 Novak Djokovic faced an even greater challenge during his fourth round match against the fearless Frenchman Gilles Simon. At the beginning stages of their match, Simon looked overwhelmed, getting broken very quickly. However, as the match progressed and Simon took the second set via tiebreak, it was clear that the match was going to be a great one. Novak eventually took the marathon match in five sets with dominating service play in the final set. After the match, which ran nearly five hours, Djokovic admitted <a href="http://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/35394565" target="_blank">the match tested his wits</a>: “…physically it was very demanding and I'm just happy to get through this one.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Some may believe that this type of a physical match could drain Djokovic and cause him to lose early in the tournament. With his 100 unforced errors, the Djoker has given his skeptics plenty of ammunition to doubt him. Combined with Federer’s dominance over Goffin in the fourth round, many may believe that the scales are finally tipped in Federer’s direction for a resounding semifinal win over Djokovic. However, I think that Djokovic’s class will ultimately prevail over the rest of the field. Ultimately, I can comfortably foresee Djokovic defeating Federer in four sets in the semis. Then, Wawrinka will put forth a challenge in the final match before the Djoker laughs his way to yet another Australian Open title.</p></div>
