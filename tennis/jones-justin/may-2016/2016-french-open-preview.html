				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">We have finally reached the end of May. While you may be thinking about your Memorial Day cookout, us over here at The Sports Whorl have a different thing on our mind: The French Open! Or as we call it in America, <a href="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/139399/freedom-fries-thumbnail.jpg" target="_blank">The Freedom Open</a>! Okay, we don’t actually call it that. But nevertheless, this year’s French Open is upon us and there are many major storylines to discuss.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Even the pre-tournament events have made headlines, as we saw <a href="../january-2016/family-friends-federer.html">Roger Federer</a> withdraw due to a back injury. While we will miss the Swiss Maestro in France, the rest of the greats will still be there. I am here to inform you of my predictions up to the semifinal round, as well as the most interesting matchups in each quarter. We begin our discussion with world-number one Novak Djokovic and his quarter.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Djokovic’s Quarter</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The draw is very friendly for Djokovic in pursuit of his first ever championship at Roland Garros. He looked extremely strong in his first round match against Yen-Hsun Lu, dropping only six games in total, and showing the world-class form that we have seen throughout 2016.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The most intriguing matchup of this quarter won’t involve the number one seed, however, as he is simply too dominant to be even remotely tested by the relatively weak draw. The Djoker was lucky to draw Berdych (ATP #7) and Ferrer (#11) as the other top seeds in his quarter.</p></div>
				
				<img src="may-tennis-article-images/djokovic.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/photos/roland-garros-2016" target="_blank">WWW.ATPWORLDTOUR.COM AND GETTY IMAGES</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The potential quarterfinal faceoff between these two top 15 players will serve as the most intriguing match of the quarter. Berdych’s all-around strength will be directly at odds with Ferrer’s high-level of conditioning. The two clashed very recently at the Madrid Masters, with Berdych winning in two close sets. However, Ferrer <a href="http://www.stevegtennis.com/head-to-head/men/Tomas_Berdych/David_Ferrer/" target="_blank">holds the career edge</a>, 11 to eight.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">While I would be inclined to take Berdych on any other surface, I am confident in Ferrer’s ability on clay. I believe that his loss in Madrid to Berdych was an anomaly to his overall performance. Expect him to outlast Berdych in five tight sets and move on to face Novak in the quarterfinals.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Ferrer’s luck will run out there, though, as he will face a focused and determined number one seed. To be honest, Djokovic shouldn’t even drop a set in this quarter, and I would be relatively surprised if he did. Ferrer is tough on clay because of his excellent conditioning and skill at the baseline. However, Novak’s endurance, combined with his far superior skill set, will prove too much for David in a quarterfinal matchup. Expect a three-set win for Djokovic in this match.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><em><b>Most Intriguing Matchup:</b> (11) Ferrer v. (7) Berydych - Round of 16</em></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><em><b>Quarterfinal Prediction:</b> (1) Djokovic def. (11) Ferrer 6-4, 7-6 (4), 6-1</em></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Nadal’s Quarter</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">“Life is great. Everything is well.” First reported by <a href="http://www.si.com/tennis/2016/05/24/french-open-day-3-recap-nadal-murray-djokovic-serena-bouchard" target="_blank">Sports Illustrated</a>, this quote captured Rafael Nadal’s mood after his comfortable first-round win over Sam Groth (unranked). This quote stood out to me, as it was the first time that I’ve heard genuine positivity from Rafa in recent memory.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">There is no doubting that Nadal has had a tough stretch of play over the past few years. With his current major tournament losing streak at seven, this period represents the longest title drought for Nadal since he won his first major tournament at Roland Garros in 2005. During this time, his mental fortitude has been truly tested, as he battles on-court injuries, as well as those lawsuit-worthy <a href="http://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/35800550" target="_blank">doping allegations</a>.</p></div>

				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/photos/roland-garros-2016" target="_blank">WWW.ATPWORLDTOUR.COM AND GETTY IMAGES</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Nonetheless, based on his play and positive attitude, Rafa seems to be in better form through the first round of this tournament. There is still a long way to go, but this man is nicknamed “The King of Clay” for a reason. A relatively easy draw as well as first-round upsets for three of the ranked players (Fognini, Anderson, and Kohlschreiber) in his region have set up Rafa for an easy trip to the quarterfinal.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In the quarterfinal, he is most likely to play French countryman Jo- Wilfried Tsonga in what should be the most intriguing match of this quarter. While the match is guaranteed to be a thriller, watching the crowd reactions may be just as interesting. Who will the patrons rally behind? Will they support their beloved countryman, or the most decorated player in Roland Garros history?</p></div>
				
				<img src="may-tennis-article-images/tsonga.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/photos/roland-garros-2016" target="_blank">WWW.ATPWORLDTOUR.COM AND GETTY IMAGES</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The action between the lines should favor Nadal. While Tsonga has been impressive this year (most notably, taking down Federer at the Miami Masters), he is still dealing with injuries that caused him to withdraw from the Italian Open this month. On top of that, Nadal currently has a career record of 70-2 (.972) at the French Open. It would take a truly Herculean effort from anyone not named Novak Djokovic to take Rafa down. Expect a Rafa win in four sets (at the most).</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><em><b>Most Intriguing Matchup:</b> (4 )Nadal v. (6) Tsonga - Round of 16</em></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><em><b>Quarterfinal Prediction:</b> (4) Nadal def. (6) Tsonga 6-3, 4-6, 6-2, 7-6 (7)</em></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Wawrinka’s Quarter</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The defending champion was certainly not given any favors by the random drawing process this year. While many think that Stanislas Wawrinka has an excellent chance at a repeat French Open championship, the murderous draw that he received has led to many doubters.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">After what should be a routine win against Jeremy Chardy (#30) in the third round, Wawrinka is slated to play two opponents that could cause him significant problems. The first of these opponents is Gilles Simon (#16). Simon is most notable for his 2016 Australian Open performance against Djokovic, in which he forced Djokovic into 100 unforced errors in a five-set loss.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">You may be wondering, “How is one forced into committing unforced errors? Doesn’t this notion go against the exact definition of unforced errors?” However, anyone who has watched Simon knows exactly what I’m talking about. Gilles is famous for his ability to return difficult shot after difficult shot, frustrating his opponents into committing unforced errors that they would not normally commit.</p></div>
				
				<img src="may-tennis-article-images/wawrinka.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/photos/roland-garros-2016" target="_blank">WWW.ATPWORLDTOUR.COM AND GETTY IMAGES</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This strategy should be especially maddening for his opponents at the French, as the clay court will slow the ball down and allow Simon to get to <em>even more</em> balls. Against a free-swinger like Wawrinka, we may see an all-time unforced errors record for a major championship. In a match that may be the most intriguing of the tournament, and may see Stan commit 120+ unforced errors, expect Stan the Man to prevail in five sets.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This will set up a likely quarterfinal showdown against Milos Raonic (#6). A rematch of this year’s Aussie quarterfinal, which was won by Raonic, this match will be surrounded by plenty of headlines. However, I expect the match to be relatively straightforward for Stan. The clay conditions will slow Raonic’s monstrous serve and make it much more manageable for Stan than it was at the Aussie. Expect Stan to prevail in four sets in this one.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><em><b>Most Intriguing Matchup:</b> (3) Wawrinka v. (16) Simon – Round of 16</em></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><em><b>Quarterfinal Prediction:</b> (3) Wawrinka def. (6) Raonic 6-4, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4</em></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Murray’s Quarter</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Without a doubt, Andy Murray’s quarterfinal is the most wide-open in this year’s French Open. Murray looked strong throughout the clay court season, actually beating Djokovic in the last tournament before the French. His 6-3, 6-3 win over Djokovic is one of only three blemishes on Novak’s 38-3 record this season.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">One may think that this would make Murray the favorite to reach the final on his side of the bracket. However, Andy’s performances in the first two rounds have brought up many doubts against his chances in this year’s French. Needing five sets to win both of his first two matches, one may question if Murray expended too much energy at the Italian Open and other previous clay events.</p></div>
				
				<img src="may-tennis-article-images/murray.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/photos/roland-garros-2016" target="_blank">WWW.ATPWORLDTOUR.COM AND GETTY IMAGES</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">My bet is on Murray to fall earlier than usual in this tournament. He faces a very odd draw in the next two rounds, with Ivo Karlović (#27) and John Isner (#15) chomping at the bit to take Murray on. Widely regarded as two of the best servers on tour, there is very little margin for error for Murray on his service games against these two opponents. If broken, there is very little hope of breaking back against either Karlović or Isner.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Ultimately, I believe Murray prevails against these two titans of the serve, benefitting from the clay’s ability to slow the ball. However, two more close matches will wear him down heading into the quarterfinal.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In this quarterfinal, I see him playing Nick Kyrgios (#17). As my upset pick of the tournament, I think Kyrgios will repeat his result at the 2014 Wimbledon by beating Richard Gasquet (#9). I then see him finally breaking through and defeating Kei Nishikori (#6), who he has a career 0-3 record against.</p></div>
				
				<img src="may-tennis-article-images/kyrgios.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/photos/roland-garros-2016" target="_blank">WWW.ATPWORLDTOUR.COM AND GETTY IMAGES</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This pick is a little bit intuition, and a little based in fact. Nick’s play has been stellar through the first two rounds, as he hasn’t dropped a set. I think that the enigmatic Australian national has finally gotten his game together at the right time. In the most interesting match of this quarter, I see Nick Kyrgios proving his doubters wrong and defeating a weathered Andy Murray in five sets.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><em><b>Most Intriguing Matchup:</b> (17) Kyrgios v. (2) Murray – Round of 16</em></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><em><b>Quarterfinal Prediction:</b> (17) Kyrgios def. (6) Murray 7-5, 3-6, 4-6, 6-3, 7-5</em></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Moving Forward</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">There you have it: look for semifinal matchups of Djokovic-Nadal and Wawrinka-Kyrgios. Here’s to an exciting first week and a half of the French Open! We all need the grandeur and class of another grand slam in our lives, especially after our four-month wait after the Aussie Open.</p></div>
