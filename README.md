# The Sports Whorl Website

The Sports Whorl was a sports journalism site that I found back in October 2015. It had a life cycle of 11 months. The first six months of the site, I hand-coded the site from scratch and did the day-to-day upkeep (article uploading, tinkering with the code base, etc.). From months 7 to 11, we moved to a WordPress site since the manual work of keeping the hand-coded site up-to-date was proving to be too time consuming.

This repo contains the site's articles, images, and more from it's first six months as a hand-coded site. Feel free to explore the site's code base here on GitHub.
