				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">During the second quarter of the NFC Championship last Sunday, Thomas Davis, the All-Pro Carolina Panthers linebacker, broke his arm while making an awkward tackle on Arizona Cardinals’ tight end Darren Fells. This unfortunate injury came shortly after an explosive, <a href="https://twitter.com/_MarcusD_/status/691422471480717313" target="_blank">Jadeveon Clowney-like backfield tackle</a> on Cardinals running back David Johnson that set the tone for the drive.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">I was sitting behind the endzone halfway across the stadium which, despite the great seats, made it difficult to tell exactly what had happened. But as soon as everyone saw Thomas Davis on one knee, clutching his right forearm, a collective hush fell over Bank of America stadium. I texted a few friends, along with my mother (I mean who else texts back quicker than your mother?), asking how bad the injury looked, and the response was universal: “It doesn’t look good. It looks like he broke his arm.” I couldn’t believe it.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In that moment, I forgot that I was lucky enough to be sitting in the stadium watching the team I love blow away the Arizona Cardinals, en route to their first Super Bowl appearance since that soul-crushing loss to the Patriots in 2004. Instead, the only thing on my mind was that Thomas Davis, one half of the best linebacker duo in the NFL, the hardest working man on the team, and the player most deserving of a Super Bowl, was being robbed of a chance to play by yet another catastrophic, untimely injury. I felt sick to my stomach thinking about it, it all seemed too cruel to fathom. When he emerged from the locker room an hour later with a hard cast on his right arm, my worst fears were confirmed. Thomas Davis had broken his arm, and would not play another down this season.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Or, so I thought.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">For any mortal man, a broken arm in the playoffs spells the end of the season. But “T.D.” is no mortal man. After the NFC Championship win, Davis said, “I’m not missing the Super Bowl. You better believe that.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">When asked how he could be so confident - in the face of overwhelming evidence that he should have every reason not be, he responded simply, “Because I believe in me.” Let me explain why you should believe in him, too.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>The Story</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Thomas Davis was drafted by the Carolina Panthers with the 14th pick in the 2005 NFL Draft. He was a highly touted prospect out of the University of Georgia. After receiving only one scholarship offer out of high school, Davis worked hard to better his game while at Georgia, and earned first-team All-American honors in his junior year.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Transitioning from Athens to Charlotte, Davis had a few meaningful seasons early on, when he cemented himself as an impact player on the defensive side of the ball, after transitioning from a safety to his new position of outside coverage linebacker in the 4-3 defensive scheme used by the Panthers. But that progress came crashing to an abrupt end.</p></div>

				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="https://www.facebook.com/CarolinaPanthers/photos/pb.112088258804189.-2207520000.1454464531./891361577543516/?type=3&theater" target="_blank">CAROLINA PANTHERS FACEBOOK ACCOUNT</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In November of 2009, Davis tore the ACL in his right knee. This was a major blow not only to Davis, but also to the Panthers, who lost a key component of their defense.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But a torn ACL is not an unusual occurrence for athletes, and can be overcome with the right attitude and diligent rehab; which is exactly what happened in Davis’s case. He had reconstructive surgery that very month and, by the next training camp, Davis was healthy and ready for the 2010 season. But yet again, while running a standard drill, he re-tore his right ACL. This was devastating for Davis, but he knew that players had come back from two torn ACLs in the past and successfully continued their careers. Discouraged but driven, he started the long and painful process all over again.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">He missed all 16 games of the 2010 season, but spent those months pouring blood, sweat, and tears into strengthening that knee into what it was before the injuries. But in the second game of the 2011 season, the unthinkable happened. Davis collapsed on the field clutching that same knee after being hit by a teammate. He knew it as soon as he went down: He’d torn his right ACL for the <em>third</em> time.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">That was it. That had to be it for Davis’s career. No player in NFL history had ever come back to play after three ACL tears to the same knee. Davis knew this, and soon after the game, he decided to call it a career. But in the coming days a tiny bit of doubt started to creep in. In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNohupr-GnY" target="_blank">interview with Fox Sports</a> he stated, “[The team trainers and his wife] asked me, ‘Do you really feel like you’re done with the game of football? Are you in your heart totally 100% sure that you don’t want to play again?’ And the answer to that question was no.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">So he didn’t call it a career; in fact, he did just the opposite. He decided to have surgery and repair the ACL for a third time. He actually had surgery on both knees, because the surgeon had to use the Patellar tendon from his left knee to repair the ACL in his right knee. He beat the odds, just like he had over and over again, and to their credit, the Panthers gave him another chance.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">People often take it for granted that the Panthers gave Davis another chance to beat the odds and return to the field, but this decision was far from a no-brainer. Think about it from the franchise’s point of view. Here was a guy that, while still a great player, had just torn his right ACL for the <em>third</em> time in less than three years. In the entire history of the NFL, no player had ever successfully returned from three ACL tears on the same knee to play another snap, let alone actually play at a high level. And Davis, known for his incredible speed, would have a difficult time fully regaining that speed after a third knee surgery. A roster spot is a valuable commodity on an NFL team, and for the Panthers to give Davis another chance to come back took a lot of guts, but most importantly, it took what Davis had in vast reserves...<em>belief</em>. The Panthers <em>believed</em> that Davis was capable of doing something that had never been done before, just as Davis <em>believed</em> he was strong enough to accomplish the seemingly impossible.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">And boy did that belief pay off.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Davis not only overcame the string of knee injuries and continued to play in the NFL, he has actually raised his game to newer and greater heights, culminating in his first Pro Bowl selection this year, while leading the Panthers to the Super Bowl.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">To help illustrate his remarkable comeback story, let’s look at some stats, shall we?</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">During his first four and a half years in the NFL until his first ACL tear in November of 2009, Davis averaged 5.6 tackles per game. After three ACL tears in less than three years, Thomas Davis averaged 7.0 tackles per game. Incredibly, he was able to not only fully recover from the knee injuries, but he also improved his game and significantly raised his tackles per game average after the injuries. In fact, nearly every defensive stat improved after his injuries. Pro Football Focus even ranked Thomas Davis as <a href="http://www.catscratchreader.com/2015/5/27/8664689/panthers-olb-thomas-davis-ranked-as-top-4-3-olb-in-the-nfl-by-pff" target="_blank">the best 4-3 Outside Linebacker</a> in the NFL after the 2014 season. His unmatched ability to read routes and stay with receivers down the field, as evidenced on <a href="http://video.nfl.com/films/2015/GAME_HIGHLIGHT/in-game-highlight/NFLCOM/REG/17/160103_bp_tb_car_davis_int_381262_5000k.mp4" target="_blank">this interception</a>, played a large part in that elite ranking.</p></div>
				
				<img src="feb-nfl-article-images/chart.png" class="each_epl_image">
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">And the Panthers have certainly reaped the rewards of Davis’s improvement. As a leader on the field and in the locker room, he has brought this defensive unit from that porous, 27th-best, “Touchdowns for everyone,” defense of the 2010-11 and 2011-12 Panthers to the truly elite, Cardiac Cat defense of the 2014-15 and 2015-16 NFL seasons, with a little help from teammate Luke Kuechly, of course. In this ongoing 2015-16 season, the Panthers defense ranked sixth in points/game allowed, third in yards/play allowed, and first (by a large margin) in turnovers forced.</p></div>
				
				<img src="feb-nfl-article-images/davis-kuechly.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="https://www.facebook.com/CarolinaPanthers/photos/pb.112088258804189.-2207520000.1454463822./999458596733813/?type=3&theater" target="_blank">CAROLINA PANTHERS FACEBOOK ACCOUNT</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The Panthers also trust Davis to make the clutch plays when they’re needed most, as evidenced by his position on the hands team for the Seattle Seahawks’ onside kick during the NFC Divisional playoff game. He wasn’t simply a member of the hands team; he was the player designated to recover the ball while the others blocked for him, a position typically reserved for only the most sure-handed players. Some of his teammates <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luuDLBFn8Bs" target="_blank">even joked after the game</a> about Davis being part of the hands team, illustrating how unusual it is for a linebacker to play this role. And yet the Panthers still put the game in his hands (literally). The coaches knew that his desire to win was so extreme that it would outweigh any potential shortcomings in the hands department. As he says himself, “Just know that in that situation I’m going to give everything I have to this team to make sure I come away with the football.” And he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvgRpINHXFg" target="_blank">did just that</a>, recovering the kick and sending the Panthers on to the next round of the playoffs.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">“Charlotte’s Sweetheart,” as he is affectionately known by Panthers quarterback Cam Newton,  has also been instrumental in helping to develop fellow linebacker and close friend Luke Kuechly. Though they have incredibly different personalities - Kuechly being the more subdued “nice guy” and Davis serving as the confident talker, they have developed quite a bond over the past four years. Panthers rookie linebacker <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/columnist/bell/2016/01/14/luke-kuechly-thomas-davis-carolina-panthers-linebackers-brothers/78825834/" target="_blank">Shaq Thompson says</a>, “They’re brothers. They connect more than probably anybody in here.” Their connection manifests itself in intense competition with one another. Each portion of that devastating defensive tandem competes relentlessly during games to swarm the ball carrier and get more tackles than the other, with the loser having to do “chores” for the other after the game.</p></div>
				
				<img src="feb-nfl-article-images/carolina-sweetheart.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="https://www.facebook.com/CarolinaPanthers/photos/pb.112088258804189.-2207520000.1454463823./990418477637825/?type=3&theater" target="_blank">CAROLINA PANTHERS FACEBOOK ACCOUNT</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">If you watch them play more than a few snaps together, their brotherly bond becomes apparent on the field as well. When one of them makes a play, the other is always the first player there to help him up and congratulate him with a helmet smack. Though they have competitions over who can get the most tackles each game, there is no selfishness there, just a desire to push themselves as hard as possible. Simply put, they bring out the best in each other, and as we’ve seen this season, their “best” is as good as anyone else’s in the NFL.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But enough about Davis as a player, let’s talk about the kind of man he is.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Thomas Davis grew up very poor in a rural town in Georgia to a single mom. He had almost nothing growing up, having to boil water on the stove if he wanted to take a hot bath, and run an extension cord from his neighbor’s house just to have a working light. On multiple occasions he has described the pain he felt on multiple Christmases when he didn’t get any presents, thinking it was his fault and, more heartbreakingly, that Santa didn’t bring him any presents because he wasn’t good enough that year.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">His difficult upbringing was a major motivation behind the organization he created in 2008, called the Thomas Davis Defending Dreams Foundation. This organization is a tutoring and mentorship program for kids that suffer from self-confidence issues in his hometown of Shellman, Georgia.</p></div>
				
				<div class="outside_quote">					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">“It teaches them the skills they’ll need to become a responsible adult and really go after their dreams.”</p>
					
					<p class="outside_quote_writing">— Sam Boykin, <em><a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/living/south-park-magazine/article9062468.html" target="_blank">The Charlotte Observer</a></em></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Many aspects of Davis’s foundation are in place to help ensure that kids don’t have to go through the same types of struggles he had endured as a child. One such event is the yearly Christmas toy giveaway, which guarantees that the kids don’t ever have to feel the way Davis did when he didn’t receive any Christmas presents. His foundation has raised over $500,000 to date, and it recently built a park for the children of his hometown, something Davis never had growing up. He is a hero to the children of his foundation, and helps ensure they have an easier time growing up than he did. If you would like to learn more about the foundation, please <a href="http://www.defendingdreams.org/" target="_blank">visit their website</a>.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In honor of his community work, Thomas Davis won the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award in 2014 after being a finalist in both 2012 and 2013. He is widely regarded as one of the most charitable players in the NFL, an incredible role model for kids everywhere, and the heart and soul of the Carolina Panthers organization. Being the type of man that Thomas Davis exemplifies on and off the field is far more important than how many Super Bowls he’ll win or how many game-changing tackles he’ll make. If you still have any doubts left about Davis, then go ahead and watch his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRZKTVA056o&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">Man of the Year acceptance speech</a>, and they’ll disappear in an instant.</p></div>

				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="https://www.facebook.com/CarolinaPanthers/photos/pb.112088258804189.-2207520000.1454464353./936145246398482/?type=3&theater" target="_blank">CAROLINA PANTHERS FACEBOOK ACCOUNT</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">So, when Thomas Davis says he’s going to play in this Sunday’s Super Bowl despite having a broken bone in his right forearm, who can possibly doubt him? As Panthers <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/14641585/lb-thomas-davis-carolina-panthers-vows-play-super-bowl-50-broken-arm" target="_blank">Defensive Tackle Kawann Short</a> said, “You will have to take his jerseys away from him — all five them, even the ones at home — before he sits out this game.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In the biggest game of his life, Thomas Davis will be there giving it all he’s got for the team he so dearly loves. So when you see him fly across your T.V. screen to wrap up the Broncos’ ball carrier, remember all that he’s been through: The painful childhood, the three ACL tears, and the years of difficult rehab, all of which has helped him grow into the outstanding man he is today. I can promise you this: For a man who has overcome each and every obstacle in his past, a broken bone in his arm won’t be the setback that keeps him out of Super Bowl 50. Instead, it provides him with another opportunity to do what he’s done time and time again: come back stronger.</p></div>
