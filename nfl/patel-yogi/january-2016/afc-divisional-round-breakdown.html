				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, Massachusetts</p>
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">Saturday, January 16, 2016</p>
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">4:35 PM EST on CBS</p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The Patriots had yet another great season and have positioned themselves for yet another Super Bowl run. The Chiefs, on the other hand, are scorching hot. Andy Reid’s Kansas City squad has won 11 straight games, including last weekend’s dominant wild-card round victory over the Houston Texans, after starting the season with a meager 1-5 record.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The bye week that the Patriots earned was exactly what the doctor prescribed. Julian Edelman, one of Tom Brady’s favorite targets, returned to practice this week after missing the final seven games of the season. It’s no surprise that the Patriots offense struggled down the stretch given the fact that they’d lost Edelman for seven games. Dion Lewis was also lost for the season with a torn ACL after the first seven games. Rob Gronkowski went down with a knee injury and missed a game. Danny Amendola missed two games due to a knee injury of his own. LeGarrette Blount went down with a hip injury after 12 games that cost him the season.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">And that injury list still doesn’t include the offensive linemen that went down with injuries. Tackle Nate Solder and center Ryan Wendell were both lost for the year. LaAdrian Waddle is dealing with a niggling shoulder injury and Sebastian Vollmer is finally healthy after being carted off with a leg injury during an overtime loss against the New York Jets. Bill Belichick has been forced to come up with creative ideas to protect Brady, who was sacked 38 times this season. Those 38 sacks are the third-highest of his illustrious career. Therefore, Brady will need Cameron Flemming, a player signed off of the practice squad, and Marcus Cannon, who has been dealing with a toe injury for most of the season, to step up and protect him against the Chiefs’ lethal pass rush.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Additionally, I would expect to see plenty of two-tight end packages to help give Brady that added protection. However, getting Edelman back and the emergence of James White as a pass-catching running back will surely help Brady find the underneath routes and set up big plays for Gronk.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">On the defensive end, the Patriots are hoping to get back linebackers Dont’a Hightower and Jonathan Freeney, defensive ends Chandler Jones, Rob Ninkovich, and safety Devin McCourty fully healthy for this weekend. This defensive unit has done a great job. They finished the regular season with 49 sacks - good for second-most in the league - with Jones leading the team with 12.5. Malcolm Butler had a great follow-up season, too, after sealing the Super Bowl victory just a year ago.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The Chiefs also have injury issues of their own that they’re battling with. Jeremy Maclin, who went down with a high ankle sprain last week, is on track to play this weekend. Quarterback Alex Smith, who had a great outing against the Texans last weekend, will need all of the offensive weapons he can get if he and his Chiefs want to beat the Patriots in Foxborough. The Chiefs have not won in New England since 1990, dropping five straight there.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Yes, the Patriots are slumping and the Chiefs are on a roll. However, the Patriots are getting healthy and this is their time of the year. Alex Smith will be under pressure all game long and that will lead to turnovers. Defensively, the Chiefs will struggle to cover the underneath routes. Gronk’s overbearing dominance should cause problems for Eric Berry and the rest of the Chiefs’ secondary unit. Because of the shaky offensive line, the protection around Brady will collapse early, but Edelman’s return is just the antidote Brady needs to overcome those shortcomings. Oh, and Belichick and the Patriots haven’t forgotten about being embarrassed by the Chiefs 41-14 last season. Add that disappointment to the fact that the Chiefs defense had the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/team/_/stat/defense/sort/sacks/seasontype/2" target="_blank">second-most interceptions in the NFL (22) and the fourth-most sacks (47.0)</a>, which means Tom Brady’s offense needs to be firing on all cylinders while keeping the lapses to a bare minimum. Expect that to be a big motivating factor in this playoffs game. The Patriots, led by a 3-TD effort from Brady, will win 34-20.</p></div>

				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">Sports Authority Field at Mile High, Denver, Colorado</p>
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">Sunday, January 17, 2016</p>
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">4:40 PM EST on CBS</p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The Steelers edged by the Broncos in their regular season match-up in a thrilling 34-27 comeback victory. Both of these teams have ailing quarterbacks, but receivers that can make any quarterback look good.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The Steelers could be very shorthanded going into this game. Running back DeAngelo Williams is a longshot to return from a right foot injury this week. Wide receiver Antonio Brown is having concussion-like symptoms, but is hoping they will subside in due time so he can pass the concussion protocol. Quarterback Ben Roethlisberger is suffering from a sprained AC joint and torn ligaments in his right shoulder. While he did return for the final drive against the Bengals, he didn’t attempt any medium range passes or, for that matter, any passes downfield. The Steelers will have to hope his arm strength is still there because Big Ben will definitely find a way to play this weekend. However, second-year sensation Martavis Bryant made a spectacular catch in the end zone last weekend, and if Brown has to miss the game, expect Bryant to make some big plays again this week. The offensive line will have to protect Roethlisberger better this week against a tough Denver defense. That way, Big Ben can play the entire game while the Steelers’ running game can find its footing similar to the way they did last week against Cincy.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The Broncos made a bold decision to go with Peyton Manning over Brock Osweiler as their starter this Sunday. Peyton did not look comfortable in the pocket against the Chargers during the last game of the season. He still has trouble planting his feet to generate enough “zip” on his throws. The cold weather doesn’t help him, either. This is the time of the year that his struggles become magnified. However, he is still the best quarterback to ever play the game, so I would expect him to start a playoff game over an inexperienced Osweiler. With Peyton starting, the Broncos are going to have to be able to run the ball effectively. While they would like for Peyton to take shots downfield against the weak Steelers’ secondary, it might be more of a risk if he still can’t get his feet planted since those sitting ducks will be preyed upon by a rabid Steelers secondary who snagged 17 interceptions during the regular season. Simply put, the Broncos will have to win this game on defense, which will be back at full strength.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">I don’t think Peyton will be comfortable in the pocket during this game. The weather and his weakened left foot will ultimately lead Manning to board the struggle bus early. Their phenomenal defense will be absolutely bewildered by the tandem of Antonio Brown and Martavis Bryant, just like they were in Week 15. Round 2 also goes to the Steelers, 27-10.</p></div>
