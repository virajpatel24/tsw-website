				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Tom Brady vs. Peyton Manning XVII. This is probably the last time we will see Brady and Manning square off against each other. Given their combined age of 77, it’s likely that their 17th meeting on Sunday will become their final one. The two future Hall of Fame quarterbacks are 2-2 against each other in the AFC Championship game. In fact, in each of those meetings, the quarterback that had the home-field advantage won each time. Overall, Brady is 11-5, including the playoffs, against Manning. This why the question on every football fan’s mind is the following: Who wins in the 17th - and perhaps final - matchup between these two legendary quarterbacks?</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The Patriots feature a high-tempo, powerful offense. With the Brady Bunch – consisting of Tom Brady, Julian Edelman, Rob Gronkowski, and Danny Amendola - fully healthy, Tom Brady can effectively run his “dink-and-dunk” offense. Last weekend against the Kansas City Chiefs, he ripped apart their secondary time and again, consistently finding Edelman on those short underneath and slant routes. The Chiefs pass rush was not able to disrupt Brady’s timing or tempo as Justin Houston and the rest of the Chiefs’ front seven were not able to get to Brady once all game. To make matters worse for the Chiefs, Brady was able to get the ball off in about 1.8 seconds on every one of his passes.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The Broncos are the opposite of the Patriots. Manning’s injuries and age have forced him to embrace a new role in the offense. Now, instead of the overpowering, record-shattering offense we saw just two years ago, Manning is forced to feature under center more instead of routinely lining up in the shotgun. Accordingly, the Broncos rely more on the Ronnie Hillman-led running game than the abysmal Peyton Manning-led air attack.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The Patriots are the only team that does not have to rely on a ground game to win a game. Brady has a stunning 46-26 record when attempting at least 40 passes in a game. Last week, the Pats only rushed the ball 14 times for a grand total of 38 yards and a touchdown - Brady himself rushed for 10 of them on one play and later scored the TD on a QB sneak. Meanwhile, Brady attempted 42 passes and connected on 28 of them for 302 yards and two touchdowns. Expect more of that tried-and-tested “dink-and-dunk” offense to cause problems for the elite Broncos defense this Sunday.</p></div>

				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="https://www.facebook.com/newenglandpatriots/photos/a.389482927371.168583.42693447371/10153909949962372/" target="_blank">NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS FACEBOOK ACCOUNT</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Danny Amendola might be the X-Factor in this game. The Broncos’ Chris Harris, who is dealing with a shoulder injury, will be guarding Edelman, regardless of where he lines up. Amendola will most likely draw multiple mismatches by lining up on the outside and in the slot. Brandon LaFell will most likely be matched up with former star Patriots CB Aqib Talib. Once Brady finds a mismatch that he likes, expect him to exploit it and force the defense to make a mistake with Gronk.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">On the offensive end, the Broncos will need to rely heavily upon their running game. Right now, the Broncos are struggling putting points on the board. If not for their defense, this game could easily get out of hand. Manning has a lackluster 46-49 record when attempting 40 or more passes in a game, and the Broncos are 9-0 when rushing for at least 105 yards this season. However, when Manning starts, they only average 88 rushing yards per game. The 39-year-old Broncos QB is still capable of making big-time plays, but he isn’t the same vintage Peyton Manning we’re used to seeing. Just last week against the Steelers, he struggled to pick up the blitz and he overthrew open receivers more than I’d like. Yes, his receivers did let him down with all of their drops, but it’s thoroughly out of character for someone like Peyton Manning to not pick up on the defensive coverage and blitzes pre-snap. To add to that, Bill Belichick has Peyton’s number and is a defensive guru. He will disguise the blitz and coverages in a multitude of ways to keep Manning guessing about what is coming post-snap. In order for the Broncos to keep up with the Patriots’ offense, they will need to establish a solid running game.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Defensively, the Patriots have to worry about keeping the Broncos one-dimensional. They have to stop the running game and force Peyton to throw passes over the middle. If they can do that, they will win this game.</p></div>
				
				<img src="jan-nfl-article-images/manning.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="https://www.facebook.com/DenverBroncos/photos/a.152313691317.139070.129494626317/10153907015826318/" target="_blank">DENVER BRONCOS FACEBOOK ACCOUNT</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Dont’a Hightower gets overlooked with the amount of talented linebackers the Patriots possess. His tackle that kept Marshawn Lynch out of the endzone in the Super Bowl last year that led to the Malcom Bulter interception was exactly the type of under-the-radar play that Hightower never seems to get enough credit for executing. In the 30-24 loss against the Broncos in Week 12, the Patriots were without linebacker Jamie Collins. Once Dont’a Hightower also left the game with injuries, the Broncos were able to rush the ball 16 times for 133 yards, while posting three touchdowns. Before Hightower left the game, the Broncos were held to only 46 rushing yards on 16 carries. This time around, the Patriots are fully healthy on defense and are highly underrated. They also boast the second-best pass rush in the league, and they are very effective getting to the quarterback even though they only usually deploy four rushers. I think they will get to Peyton consistently and force bad throws over the middle. The Broncos will then respond with the ground game, which will be easily contained by the Pats defense. To put the nail on the coffin, Hightower will force a crucial turnover early, giving the Patriots the game-clinching momentum shift.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But don’t discount the Broncos, who have one of the best defenses. Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware lead a strong front seven and Aqib Talib and Chris Harris spearhead a strong secondary. They will have to find ways to get to Brady within two seconds in order to truly disrupt his passing game. The Broncos’ defense will not have to worry too much about stopping a ground game since the Patriots will not rely on Stephen Jackson, James White, and Brandon Bolden to carry the ball when they have such a potent passing attack. However, they will have the arduous task of guarding Julian Edelman and Rob Gronkowski. For their pass rush to get to Brady, they will have to fan out keep Brady from stepping up in the pocket. Ultimately, if the Broncos want to win, they will have to sack Brady and pressure him into making bad throws in the vicinity of Talib and Harris.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Despite it being “Brady vs. Manning: Round 17,” this game will come down to a battle of defenses. The Broncos have the better defense, but the Patriots defense is very underrated and will take the field in Denver having something to prove. On the coaching end of things, the Patriots have the smartest coach in NFL history in Bill Belichick, who has Peyton’s number. In the end, the Pats will force the Broncos into costly turnovers while Brady and Co. find ways to shred the Broncos’ secondary. My prediction: The Patriots win a close game behind a 3-touchdown effort again from Tom Brady and the Patriots advance to Super Bowl 50 behind a 24-21 victory.</p></div>
