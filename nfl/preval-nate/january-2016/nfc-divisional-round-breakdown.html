				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b><u>Green Bay Packers vs. Arizona Cardinals</u></b></p></div>
		
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">University of Phoenix Stadium, Glendale, Arizona</p>
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">Saturday, January 16, 2016</p>
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">8:15 PM EST on NBC</p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">After completely unraveling the Washington Redskins last Sunday night, the Green Bay Packers look forward to establishing their prowess against the Arizona Cardinals. In Week 16, the Arizona Cardinals pummeled the Packers with a humbling 38-8 scoreline in a game that was decided by the third quarter. Green Bay has struggled all season with their offense, seemingly showing up with all of their game-changing personnel one week, but then, the following week, barely appearing as a shadow of themselves. This is largely due to the loss of their primary target, Jordy Nelson. To make matters worse, the offensive line for the Packers had been plagued with injuries all season and all of their starters have not been able to finish a whole game since Week 9 against the Panthers.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The cherry on top is their lack of an explosive running game. Eddie Lacy and company have been unable to produce much out of the backfield all season; out of the four remaining NFC teams, the Packers put up the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/team/_/stat/rushing/seasontype/2" target="_blank">worst rushing numbers in the regular season</a>. Last week we saw Lacy show some spunk as he posted 12 carries for 63 yards and a touchdown to get the Packers oriented towards a Super Bowl run. Despite their 38-8 mauling of the Cheeseheads in Week 16, the Cardinals had not faced a Packers team that had a rolling run game. Since the run game usually opens up their offense, Aaron Rodgers will could have a field day against this battered Cardinals secondary, given the loss of Tyrann Mathieu, as well as Alex Okafor.</p></div>

				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="http://www.revengeofthebirds.com/2016/1/14/10766936/2016-nfl-playoffs-protection-hasnt-been-an-issue-for-arizona" target="_blank">WWW.REVENGEOFTHEBIRDS.COM</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">For Arizona, Carson Palmer is having one of the best seasons of his career and, overall, the team is also having some success, as evidenced by their 13-3 regular season record. Since the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2290239" target="_blank">devastating knee injury</a> he sustained in 2005, Palmer’s stats had fallen by the wayside. His stints with the Oakland Raiders and the Cincinnati Bengals were short-lived, and the steady stream of debilitating injuries continued to come. But he finally found his fit in Arizona in 2013 and now, at age 36, there are truly no signs of him slowing down. He even closed the 2015-2016 regular season with 35 touchdowns and a QB rating of 104.6, second-best and third-best in the league, respectively. Carson Palmer’s success this season wouldn’t have been possible without his favorite receiver, Larry Fitzgerald, contributing in all 16 games. Mr. Fitzgerald has over 100 receptions this season and has latched onto 1,215 of Palmer’s 4,671 passing yards, easily making himself a known presence on the field at all times. Arizona’s number 11 hasn’t posted these kinds of numbers since their Super Bowl run during the 2008-2009 season.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Arizona’s air game is mixed in with a consistent ground game, too, thanks to the exploits of running backs Chris Johnson, David Johnson, and Andre Ellington. Together, they’ve been able to make themselves a very well-rounded spectacle on offense, almost similar to Green Bay’s offense, albeit without the running threat of the quarterback. Without a shadow of a doubt, this match-up will be a game of Russian Roulette. It’s just a matter of who takes the hit first. The Packers have been able to rally late in a few games, like the miraculous Rodgers-to-Rodgers connection on Aaron Rodgers’ birthday to seal the 27-23 win against the Lions on December 3rd. The Cardinals have been forced to play consistently, not missing a beat this season until their Week 17 loss to the Seahawks during which no player in red truly showed up (and everyone knows it). Hopefully that lackluster, nonchalant style of play does not carry over to this weekend, particularly when the not-so-good Packers defense awaits them. Although, the greatness of Aaron Rodgers is usually a force to be reckoned with, unfortunately, Green Bay will ultimately lose this matchup by at least a touchdown this weekend.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b><u>Seattle Seahawks vs. Carolina Panthers</u></b></p></div>
		
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">Bank of America Stadium, Charlotte, North Carolina</p>
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">Sunday, January 17, 2016</p>
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">1:05 PM EST on FOX</p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Since the Carolina Panthers and the Arizona Cardinals hold the first and second seeds in the NFC, respectively, they both secured a first-round bye, allowing their players plenty of time to rest ahead of this week’s match-ups. Due to a late missed field goal by the Vikings last weekend, the Seattle Seahawks stole a close one in the frozen tundra that is Minnesota. Fortunately for the Seahawks, they’re coming south to North Carolina, a state where the weather is warmer, but the competition is much more stiffer.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Last week, Pete Carroll’s Seahawks faced some tough competition in the Vikings. The Hawks had picked up steam throughout the season and seemed to be going into the playoffs with a considerable amount of momentum. But, as you science folks already know, particles slow down when exposed to cooler temperatures. And, accordingly, both teams struggled to move the ball, as the passing and rushing attacks remained lifeless. The young QBs on hand, Teddy Bridgewater and Russell Wilson, went 17-of-24 with 176 yards and 13-of-26 with 142 yards, respectively. Wilson also contributed 5 rushes for 21 yards to the Seattle attack. But his greatest contribution came during a dangerous fumble that soon transformed into a big-time play, thanks to Wilson’s poise under pressure. The only touchdown of the game came from Seattle early in the fourth quarter on a short throw to Doug Baldwin, which eventually sealed the deal as the Vikings could not keep up with the cold at home.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">As Seattle’s preparation shifts from Minnesota’s Winterfell to Carolina’s King’s Landing, the Seahawks find themselves all too familiar with the Panthers’ gameplan. The two teams have faced off against each other three times in the last two seasons, one of which came just a little over a year ago in the NFC Divisional round, during which the Seahawks defeated the Panthers 31-17 en route to a Super Bowl appearance.</p></div>
				
				<img src="jan-nfl-article-images/kuechly.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="http://www.catscratchreader.com/2016/1/14/10763760/carolina-panthers-vs-seattle-seahawks-defensive-preview" target="_blank">WWW.CATSCRATCHREADER.COM</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But the Panthers have come a long way forward from that tough 2015 loss and are truly enjoying this season, having gone 15-1. The Cardiac Cats seem to be firing efficiently on all cylinders, including their running game, even though Jonathan Stewart has been out for the last month with an ankle injury. We’ve seen their defense take their feet off the gas pedal, most notably during the tough outings against the Falcons in Atlanta and the Giants in the Meadowlands. But, for the most part, they have been able to turn it around and make the critical plays when necessary in order to preserve their victory. And confidence won’t be an issue since they already defeated the Seahawks earlier this season in a 27-23 victory back in Week 6.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But in that narrow win, Seattle took the field without their star running back Marshawn Lynch, who has been in-and-out of the lineup, citing his nagging injury woes. The Seahawks have found their identity offensively, relying on their run as much as they can behind Wilson’s elusiveness under center. He is arguably the most difficult quarterback to defend against, behind soon-to-be-MVP Cam Newton, due to his pinpoint accuracy, poise under pressure, and creativity when the offense sputters. His ability to either throw the ball accurately or, on a whim, tuck the ball and take off for a short gain gives defenses nightmares while preparing during practices and a migraine while containing him on game day. Both of the teams are just about the same - high-energy offense and every down defense. This game will be extremely tight - and with the flow of these playoffs, being at home does not make it any easier. Despite the Seahawks rallying the troops and getting by last week, they will be missing their 12th man in Carolina and will lose by a slim margin, potentially no more than a field goal.</p></div>
