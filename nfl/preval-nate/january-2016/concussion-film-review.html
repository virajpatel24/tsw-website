				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">“Concussion” was advertised and displayed as a film exposing the truth behind some - emphasis on “some” - of the science behind repetitive head trauma in concussions and the long-term effects of such actions. With the findings of neuropathologist, Dr. Bennet Omalu (Will Smith), we learned that, in death, the brain shows signs of suffocation from within, stemming from repetitive hits to the head. This medical phenomena is called chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which is widely referred to as CTE. The film, directed by Peter Landesman, opens with the Hall of Fame speech (Class of 1997) being delivered by Mike Webster (David Morse), who was a Pittsburgh Steeler from 1974-1990. Webster has been regarded as one of the best centers to ever play the game of football and was the anchor for the Steelers’ offense during his tenure there, thoroughly earning the nickname “Iron Mike.”</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">After the speech, the audience is sidetracked with information on Dr. Bennet Omalu’s life, his work at the Allegheny County Coroner’s Office as a forensic pathologist, and the bizarre ways with which he performed autopsies on the dead. The flow of the first two-thirds of the film follows this back-and-forth, nonlinear manner, during which we see both the work Dr. Omalu is conducting and then the events unfurling outside of his story, which would later come to affect his work. Mike Webster’s condition is illustrated worse than one would think and, thus, is one of the many inconsistencies the film provides. Mike Webster became homeless, was offered help by friends, family, and even fans - but refused it. His erratic behavior also pushed people away, including former teammate Justin Strzelczyk, who also suffered from CTE.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In the film, Strzelczyk goes to visit Webster at his pickup truck just outside a train station. He tries pleading to Webster to seek help as he was caught inhaling ammonia, a sample of some of that erratic behavior mentioned before. In the end, Webster was experiencing such dissociation that his best friend and teammate, Strzelczyk, left him. Shortly thereafter, Webster made a valid attempt to seek help by visiting one of his team doctors, Dr. Julian Bailes (masterfully played by Alec Baldwin). The casting of Baldwin may have been the best choice for any character in the film, apart from Dr. Omalu and his wife. Baldwin certainly fits the profile of a former NFL team doctor in both stature and style. There was also a cunning gravitas about his character which permeates the film, and it’s something only an actor of Baldwin’s pedigree could’ve successfully delivered.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">When Webster visits Dr. Bailes, he is inconsolable. Mike is crying, yelling, aggressive, even a little physical. Bailes is left questioning: “What am I missing?” That question aptly alludes to what is occurring in the frazzled mind of Mike Webster and his overall condition. The audience sees what Mike endures - the voices (almost implying schizophrenia), the involuntary movements, the impulses, the depression. In actuality, some of the depression was due to his life falling apart, but it was not as extreme as the film depicted. Bailes gives him a dosage of Haldol, which treats bipolar disorder, as well as dementia, and sends him on his way. Webster eventually passes away at age 50 due to a self-inflicted stun gun shock to his leg, causing heart failure. But audiences will agree that the medicine he was taking, and the way he was living, clearly showed that he was long gone before that.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">At this point, the film turns back to Dr. Omalu, the lucky man of the hour. Despite facing scrutiny and pressure for his style, the doctor is fortunate enough to receive this hall of famer in his coroner’s office. The autopsy is done on Webster’s body and yet Omalu remains troubled. How can a man - seemingly almost in perfect physical health - be dead so young? So he asked to examine the brain. Fans in the coroner’s office wanted Omalu to simply bag Webster’s body up and finish the remaining paperwork. However, Omalu decided against it and funded the subsequent examination himself since it had become a pressing issue with his superior. The decision would eventually cost him a total of twenty thousand dollars, but it jump-started the chain of events that would lead Bennet Omalu, in due time, to knock on the NFL’s front door.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The next third of the film surrounds his research and then introduces the underlying love story behind the film. Dr. Omalu lived alone, but one of the priests at his church pulled him aside after service and asked if he could house a woman from Nigeria who needed help getting on her feet in the States. He was reluctant, but he accepted. The first impression of his apartment would initially make one think that it was hastily abandoned. The camera panned to show old food sitting on the counter and piles upon piles of books and paperwork scattered everywhere. Prema, Omalu’s new housemate, did not seem to mind, though. She just looked overwhelmed and awkward by her new environment.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Meanwhile, Dr. Omalu’s research began to take some form. Honestly, if the audience was not drawn in by now, they never would be. The grafted slices of Webster’s brain showed red spots, something that would not show up on a CAT scan, leading to a breakthrough. Gaining two separate opinions in the Pittsburgh area from other neuropathologists, they moved towards publishing the findings. Gaining that steam, the movement towards publishing was smooth and the blossoming of the Omalu-Prema love story was coming through in full force. The audience really gets to see how straight and narrow Omalu was. He hadn’t danced before and the scene during which he found his rhythm with Prema was metaphorical physically, as well as spiritually and emotionally. The following scene when Will Smith shows his trademark goofiness to Prema as they get back home is both charming and adorable. It doesn’t surprise when they spend the night together in the same room.</p></div>

				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">WILL SMITH AND DR. BENNET OMALU AT "CONCUSSION" PREMIERE. PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="http://media.gq.com/photos/566eee3cd3887844241060b5/16:9/pass/will-smith-bennet-omalu-concussion.jpg" target="_blank">WWW.GQ.COM</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Unfortunately, with romance in films, comes the aggravation. Omalu and the rest of his publishing group are taking the battle to the NFL. In exchange, the league continued to deny and refute the research and work that was conducted in order to discover CTE. Omalu and his colleagues all began to receive threats. Omalu had begun to doubt his own work, wondering why he even decided to go this slippery route with a major corporation like the NFL. Prema, to her credit, is seen constantly supporting Dr. Omalu in the endeavor, explaining to him that it is his job is to expose the truth to the world, the truth that repetitive hits to the head can cause permanent damage to the brain. On the NFL side of matters, things could not be more frustrating as Dr. Omalu points out that the lead researcher for the league’s concussion committee was a rheumatologist, who would not know as extensively about trauma to the brain the way a pathologist, like Dr. Omalu, would.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The ineptitude of the committee appointed by former NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue was immense and had to be exposed. With the direct help of Dr. Bailes, Omalu finally got into talks with members of the NFL leadership, specifically Dr. Joseph Maroon (Arliss Brown), with whom Omalu pleads to <em>tell the truth</em>. The camera work for this scene was pristine. The multiple camera angles used to depict this conversation was topped off with the point of view of Maroon, who experienced the unparalleled passion and the undying desire in Omalu’s eyes, as shown below.</p></div>
				
				<div class="video_container"><iframe class="youtube_video" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Gv7S5Xxs-Zc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The group is given the opportunity to speak to the league at a summit held in Chicago. While there, Omalu works tirelessly to try and bring up the concussion research with all of the NFL executives in attendance. Omalu and Bailes are seen at a restaurant carefully preparing for the summit the evening before.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Bailes, being the guy who had been a part of the NFL for years, has so much more to lose in this risky attempt to show the NFL the truth they’ve conveniently sought to avoid. Unfortunately, the entire summit was a hoax. It was simply a politically correct way to hear out Bailes, instead of even entertaining the idea of Omalu speaking directly to them. It even includes Dave Duerson (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), who confronted Omalu in the hall, an inconsistency the film holds, as he threatens Omalu and aggressively asserts that the good doctor’s work is simply voodoo holistic medicine.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">After the fiasco that was the Health and Safety Conference, the constant threats and phone calls to his personal home from fans of the NFL and city leadership, Dr. Omalu decided that Pittsburgh was no longer the home that he once considered. So Prema, now his wife, and Omalu moved across the country to California. This was also an attempt to get away from the ensuing controversy shrouding him and leaving it in the past, as the NFL had destroyed his research and his name.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Later on in the film, we see Dave Duerson experience similar symptoms to Webster and Strzelczyk, and eventually takes his life while leaving a note saying to donate his brain to research for CTE, specifically to Omalu. Duerson did not actually request Omalu but requested it be sent to the Boston University School of Medicine, where CTE research was being conducted in 2011. Omalu received a call in the middle of the night from Bailes passing along the news of Duerson’s passing and the ramifications that the sad event brought upon their research.</p></div>

				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">WILL SMITH AND ALEC BALDWIN FILMING A SCENE IN "CONCUSSION." PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Crouch-Concussion-1200.jpg" target="_blank">THE NEW YORKER</a></p>
	
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Dr. Omalu is later invited to speak to the Players’ Association in an attempt to finally set the record straight, which leads to the overall truth of the film. The film was not an attack on football, nor was it an attack on the American public and what they like to do in their free time, despite the NFL owning the same day of the week that churches used to own. It is a mere flashlight shone upon a part of the NFL’s history during which the league tried, with all of their money and power, to refute and deny. The NFL dropped the ball on the concussion research throughout those years. It took the league seven years to publicly acknowledge the fact that CTE was not found in just armed service veterans or boxers, but also in their own players, who fans adore and applaud every Sunday of the NFL season.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The film did come with its fair share of inconsistencies and aspects that can or cannot be proven. From an aesthetic point of view, the angles chosen were subjective to what was happening in every scene, giving the audience different things to keep in mind. Omalu’s passion for his job is seen every time he was both at work and while he was making his case to those who were uncertain. His love and admiration for Prema, his wife, was displayed with a bit of gentleness and openness despite the couple’s arduous character arcs.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Many media outlets and analysts were expecting this film to be more of an attack on the NFL, getting more critical reception from NFL leadership. Instead, it merely was a well-told story about a Nigerian-immigrant-turned-doctor making the most of his American dream by, for once, doing what is right. In our current American society, there is too much of brushing things under the rug and not enough of doing what is ethically right, whether it’s gun violence, history lessons in schools, or political agendas. Immigrants, like Dr. Bennet Omalu, appreciate the opportunity to be in such a free country and hold it to such a high standard. America is just below the idea of Heaven to these grateful folks. Although, he experienced Hell and some grief throughout the ordeal that resulted as a byproduct of removing the NFL off of its pedestal and putting the whole league under the microscope for critical analysis, his life holds true to the values that people in our society often forget: The little things are what make life worthwhile.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Overall, I enjoyed the film, despite the historical inconsistency and the brutal, almost horrendous casting of Luke Wilson as Roger Goodell, everything else seemed to belong in the film, despite the last third of the film taking a bit of a dry spell prior to the NFLPA conference. “Concussion” is definitely a film to take the family to watch as it will allow all involved to understand the consequences that come with poor tackling and coaching techniques, as well as long-term, uncontrolled, trauma to the body, in general. With the NFL now taking a better stance, after seven long years of neglectful ignorance, we see safer, and more evolved tackling methods becoming commonplace in training camps as players learn how to tackle without the helmets on. The NFL is also mandating the penalizing of helmet-to-helmet hits, as well as blindside hits to unaware targets.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">No one wants to disband football or make it less masculine - it just needs to be safe, controlled, and constantly cognizant of the evident long-term consequences. Too many lives have been lost to CTE. And the side problems that come with that affliction are not welcome trespassers for any human being. It was time to make a change. With Dr. Omalu’s work, some changes did get implemented. But, hopefully, we’ll see even more change in the future.</p></div>
