				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">We are now heading full steam towards Conference Championship weekend. Last weekend in the NFC divisional round, the Carolina Panthers and the Arizona Cardinals were forced to play to the last whistle in their games against the Seattle Seahawks and the Green Bay Packers, respectively. However, despite the close final scores, it was evident that while one matchup seemed to be over midway through the second quarter, the other would definitely enter into overtime, which made for two equally entertaining games.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The Cardinals and Packers faced off in a gritty battle led by two incredible quarterbacks in Carson Palmer and Aaron Rodgers. Unfortunately, one team’s receivers - cough, cough...Green Bay...cough, cough - definitely did not show up for the whole game. The Cardinals won in overtime after Rodgers made a couple of hail mary passes to the opportunistic Jeff Janis, their up-and-coming offensive weapon, to push the game into extra time. The game, however, was sealed by Arizona on a dump pass to a veteran juggernaut named Larry Fitzgerald.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Behind a shaky offense, Aaron Rodgers went 24/44 on 261 yards passing while converting on two touchdowns and throwing only a single interception. Without a consistent and reliable running game, it was difficult to get any rhythm going, especially with the Cardinals’ secondary sticking to their assignments like Super Glue instead of being fooled into preparing for the run. Although their rushing attack has improved in the postseason, Green Bay coach Mike McCarthy has already indicated that <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/14598575/mike-mccarthy-green-bay-packers-mccarthy-says-eddie-lacy-slim-2016-season" target="_blank">Lacy must slim down</a> prior to next season. Having used him as an every down back in the past, his role on the team has now turned to an early down back, leaving the grunt work of the run game and offensive attack solely upon on Starks and Rodgers. On a positive note, the offensive line for the Packers kept the pass rush at bay, only allowing a lone sack on the day. On top of that, they allowed Lacy to break out a 61-yard rush. Even Aaron Rodgers was well-protected as he conducted a 19-yard scramble of his own.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Carson Palmer and company had a similar game (but with even less rushing and close to the same amount of passing) as Palmer went 25/41 on 349 yards passing, three touchdowns - one of which came in the Cards’ only possession in overtime - and two interceptions. Unfortunately, there’s some work that needs to be done for Arizona. Despite the great game, Palmer was seemingly conservative in the pass game and throwing the interceptions did not help his cause. On top of that, the offensive line allowed the Packers’ pass rush to get to their QB too easily, as they allowed three sacks on the day. The ground game was completely obsolete and the play call eventually abandoned that approach, leaving Palmer to fend for himself and carry the offense on his arm. Fortunately, they pulled out the win behind Fitzgerald’s explosive 8 receptions for 176 yards. Fitz’s big-time 75-yard reception in OT helped seal the deal.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">On Sunday, football fans took a quick trip to the East Coast to see a high octane Carolina Panthers team that’s literally firing on all cylinders dismantle Russell Wilson’s Seattle Seahawks on their way to a 31-24 win. The Seahawks could not get <em>anything</em> going until it was conceivably too late. The Panthers had scored 31 points by half-time. They also took the ball away twice in the matchup. The Cardiac Cats started the game with a big-time 59-yard run from Jonathan Stewart, who had been gone for the last month with an ankle injury. He, shortly thereafter, punched the ball in and finished the day 106 yards on 19 carries and two touchdowns. That was the first rushing attack over 100 yards all season on that Seahawks defense. Unfortunately, J-Stew ended up sustaining another injury to that same ankle and has missed practice this week. But he is expected to play in the NFC Championship game.</p></div>

				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="https://www.facebook.com/CarolinaPanthers/photos/pb.112088258804189.-2207520000.1453499681./1111195762226762/" target="_blank">CAROLINA PANTHERS FACEBOOK ACCOUNT</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The rushing attack is the focal point of the Panthers’ offense. The Panthers are currently on a 30 game streak of rushing over 100 yards, the longest streak since the ‘74-’76 Steelers. Apart from the running backs, Cam Newton is also a big rushing threat for them. Although he had a quiet day scrambling, he was far from quiet in the pocket, despite the non-threatening stat line. He finished 16/22 on 161 passing yards and one touchdown. Dabbin’ Cam also ran out of the pocket a considerable amount of times, mainly in the second half, when the offense could not get anything going. Even though the Seahawks had not disturbed the scoreboard operator at all in the first half, they powered through the second half by posting 24 unanswered points. Late in the fourth quarter, the Panthers defense finally had an answer for Russell Wilson, who, until that point, seemed to have no problem exposing Robert McClain in the Panthers’ secondary.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Don’t be misled: Russell Wilson had an abysmal first half. He threw two interceptions - one of which was returned for a touchdown by Luke Kuechly, converting the first defensive touchdown during the playoffs in franchise history. Their run game had fallen apart in the opening quarter and Russell Wilson had little to no protection throughout the game, being sacked <b>FIVE</b> times, and forced to attempt a third down conversion 11 times. That would’ve easily made it difficult for any team to get going, especially after only converting five times on third down (many of which were third-and-long conversions). But in the second half, they caught their second wind and went on to score 24 unanswered points before they were eventually stopped by Thomas Davis Sr., who recovered an onside kick with under two minutes in the fourth.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Now that we know their recent past, where exactly does this leave the Cardinals and the Panthers heading into their highly-anticipated clash this weekend in snowy Charlotte?</p></div>
				
				<img src="jan-nfl-article-images/snow-panthers.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="https://www.facebook.com/CarolinaPanthers/photos/pb.112088258804189.-2207520000.1453499681./1112662498746755/" target="_blank">CAROLINA PANTHERS FACEBOOK ACCOUNT</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Well, the Panthers definitely have the motivational edge moving forward. Since Ron Rivera’s men know that this is not the first time they’ve let a big lead slip away and have had to close it out late in the past, they will be preaching consistency and playing to the final whistle this week in practice. The defensive backs unit will be putting in extra shifts in order to ensure that the coverage they need in the secondary, especially with a predator like Larry Fitzgerald roaming, allows them to cover properly during the important game this weekend. In general, the defense will be preparing for a long, cold day on that side of the ball. The Cardinals do not have a steady run game to really be concerned about, but they do have the play call to make it a hard day. So focusing in on the air game will be the key for the Panthers. With the Cardinals, they have a lot to work on. Without a run game, will Palmer be okay to throw 40-50 times against this steel curtain of Panther players? Only time can tell. Both offenses are equipped to score big points and both defenses are missing key players. With the loss of Tyrann Mathieu, the Cardinals are beginning to run thin with their secondary unit, but they have been able to depend on Patrick Peterson for their coverage needs and, as a result, they’ve accounted for plenty of takeaways this season.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Without a threatening run game, the Cardinals’ best method in keeping the Carolina defense from guessing will be subdued. Carson Palmer and the Arizona offense have the potential to engage in a shootout with the Panthers, but at the end of the day, their defense will not have enough steam to keep up with the three-headed monster featuring Cam, J-Stew, and Greg Olsen. My prediction: The Panthers will be heading to their second Super Bowl appearance in franchise history this weekend after they pull the curtain on, arguably, the best season of Carson Palmer’s career. A 41-31 Panthers victory is on the cards (no pun intended).</p></div>
