				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">After another standout victory for the Panthers this past week, it’s easy to see why the Carolina Panthers are America’s new up-and-coming favorite NFL team. With everyone seemingly doing (and ruining) the Dab, Cam Newton is making his way into the hearts of fans and the eyes of analysts everywhere. His stunning performance against the Atlanta Falcons last weekend set a new standard for the mobile-pocket-hybrid quarterback as we’ve seen his consistent efficiency on display throughout the past few weeks. His QBR has not budged over the last two weeks, sitting well over the 100+ club and nearing that same mark <em><a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/player/_/stat/passing/sort/quarterbackRating" target="_blank">for this entire season</a></em>.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">On top of Cam’s ability to sling the ball downfield to his variety of offensive weapons of mass destruction (and victory), the Panthers have had the luxury of utilizing Jonathan Stewart as their starting running back. Oh, and Stewart is currently the third leading rusher in the NFL with 989 yards. Last week against the Falcons, he converted 10 rushes for 75 yards. Unfortunately, he is listed as “inactive” this week after spraining his foot in the same game. The Panthers announced earlier today that they will be relying on Fozzy and Tolbert while also giving rookie running back Cameron Artis-Payne, who will also get a few opportunities after being inactive the previous six weeks due to the strong performances from Stewart and others.</p></div>

				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="https://www.facebook.com/CarolinaPanthers/photos/a.171939546152393.42410.112088258804189/1082245658455106/" target="_blank">CAROLINA PANTHERS FACEBOOK ACCOUNT</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">After the mass scrutiny of Ted Ginn Jr. immediately following the thrilling 41-38 win against the Saints, he rebounded this past weekend against Atlanta by making two critical receptions for 120 yards. His two touchdowns speak for themselves. Ginn’s running mate, Jerricho Cotchery, has been his usual reliable self, making critical catches when his number is called. However, this season, with the early loss of star receiver Kelvin Benjamin, tight end Greg Olsen has emerged as the Panthers’ leading receiver, clearing the second-best receiver, Ginn, by over 300 yards. He has really settled into Cardiac Cats’ offensive scheme and has taken roughly 99 percent of all of possible snaps this season. Offensively, Newton may be the engine that keeps the Panthers Porsche rolling, but Olsen is the rims, wheels, AC/Heating, Cruise Control, and much, much more of the Carolina Panthers.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">On the defensive side, Thomas Davis and Luke Kuechly are truly doing special things this year. They are the one-two punch on <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/team/_/stat/total/position/defense" target="_blank">the NFL’s third-best defense</a> (heading into this weekend). Statistically speaking, they are neck-and-neck in tackles made, as well as in interceptions. With both of them on the field, especially at the same time, it is hard for opponents to anticipate anything beyond ten yards when the Davis-Kuechly tank is wrecking through every snap, every cross route, every tackle, and every play. With the pressure that the Davis-Kuechly duo brings on through the heart of the defense, the deep-ball is protected yet another dynamic pair: Kurt Coleman and Josh Norman. Coleman, a safety, has emerged as the clean up guy during plays. He will finish the tackles and catch interceptions while providing that dual-threat coverage during which you cannot escape his presence. Josh Norman has managed to single-handedly defend one side of the field – not unlike Seattle’s Richard Sherman from two seasons prior - and has made a substantial case for the title of “The Best CB in the NFL.” He leads the team in both passes defended and interception yards. You’re not getting through him. On second thought, you’re probably not getting through Kuechly and Davis, either. But kudos for trying!</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The Giants have finally managed to turn this abysmal season around. Seemingly, they’ve done so by doing what they hadn’t been doing in weeks past…playing football. With only ONE rushing touchdown on the season, running back Rashad Jennings has not exactly provided the most reliable running game to support Eli Manning’s passing. To make matter worse, he’s only averaging 3.7 yards per carry in 138 attempts. The Giants, and a lot of the NFC East in general, do not have the best of offensive lines this season. No one seems to be rushing the ball potently in that division. The Cowboys and the Eagles sit outside the top 10 in NFL’s team rushing yardage leaders, while the Giants and the Redskins appear in the dreaded bottom 10, <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/team/_/stat/rushing" target="_blank">per ESPN</a>.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The only bright spot in this gloom-and-doom 2015-16 NFL season for the Giants is having one of the league’s best receivers in Odell Beckham Jr. Singlehandedly (and literally with his spectacular single-handed catches), he is potentially the only reason why the Giants would even be in contention for a playoff spot with their indefensible 6-7 record. At 1320 receiving yards, Beckham Jr. is third in the league in receiving yards behind good company in Atlanta’s Julio Jones (1426 yards) and Pittsburgh’s Antonio Brown (1397 yards). Not to mention, in his first 25 games, he has accumulated more receiving yards and touchdowns than any other receiver. Ever. Needless to say, if the Giants want to move forward, he has to get the ball in his hands. The key to that, besides the play call from the sideline, is Eli Manning.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Since winning the Super Bowl, Eli Manning has been a shell of himself. In 2013, he retreated even further into that shell by throwing more interceptions (27) than touchdowns (18). With a suspect running game and a porous offensive line, he hasn’t had the opportunity to confuse the defense and get the ball to the open man with efficiency. Fortunately for him, the Giants have adapted to this lack of time in the pocket and have adapted to a West Coast-style offense, gaining short gains throughout the game to hopefully open up the big match-up on whichever (unfortunate) defensive back has the opportunity to defend OBJ. This season, up to this point, Manning is posting the highest QBR of his career, showing the combined positive effects that stem from having this kind of an offense and a lethal weapon at wide receiver, like OBJ.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Unfortunately for the Giants, there is entirely too much coverage to deal with on both sides of the ball. The Giants have not had a tough-as-nails defense since the days of Justin Tuck and Jason Pierre-Paul rampaging towards the opposing quarterback at all costs and simultaneously breaking season sack records and gaining Pro Bowl accolades. Their defense has been decimated over time by injury and retirement. These effects can be shown by just watching JPP attempt to make tackles for a loss with a club on his hand the size of Mars. (Seriously, have you <a href="http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/563fbab8bd86ef1d5d8bd128/jason-pierre-paul-is-wearing-a-club-on-his-damaged-hand-in-first-game-since-fireworks-accident.jpg" target="_blank">seen that thing</a>?)</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">While we can certainly attempt to ascertain exactly what (or who) is to blame for the Giants’ natural ability to lose games late in the fourth quarter this season, I will spare you the trouble. It comes down to two important factors: A shaky coaching operation and a destructible defense. Could conditioning be the problem? Maybe lack of football IQ? Is the coaching staff just entirely too conservative? Whatever the cause may ultimately be, we know full well that the answer required to beat the perfect Carolina Panthers most certainly won’t be gift-wrapped as an early Christmas present and dropped off on the front steps of these hapless, but resurging Giants.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b><u>My Prediction</u></b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Although the Giants will show some glimmer of greatness and increased enthusiasm heading towards the end of the season, the game will more than likely be over early in the fourth quarter. Cam Newton will likely run in two touchdowns and throw for three more - one apiece to Olsen, Cotchery, and Tolbert. Josh Norman will probably have an interception this week after not getting one last week. It will be a tough outing for Eli Manning. And Odell Beckham Jr. will have the worst game of his record-breaking season (partially because of Eli and partially because of the Panthers’ Norman).</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Although it hurts me to admit this (in writing, no less!) as a born-and-bred Giants fan, the Panthers will probably breeze through this game, just as they did last weekend against the Falcons.</p></div>
