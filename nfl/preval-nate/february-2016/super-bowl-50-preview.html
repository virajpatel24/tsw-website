				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Yogi Patel:</b> To no one’s surprise, the Denver Broncos, led by future Hall of Famer Peyton Manning, enter Super Bowl 50 as the underdogs against a dangerous Carolina Panthers squad, led by MVP frontrunner Cam Newton. The Broncos are desperate to get Manning his second ring, which has proved to be as elusive as ever. Here are the keys to a Broncos victory in Santa Clara.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>1. The Sheriff Has to Run the Town</b></p></div>
		
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Peyton Manning, a.k.a. The Sheriff, is playing much differently than we have seen him play in the past. Traditionally, he has relied upon his arm to win various games; however, heading into this year’s Super Bowl, we will see him take on the role of a game manager. Despite being labeled a “game manager,” Manning has not thrown an interception since being pulled against the Chiefs after throwing four picks. Additionally, Manning was not sharp two weeks ago in the AFC Championship game against the New England Patriots – his defense was able to stop the Patriots’ offense and his receivers made some pretty good catches, but the Sheriff didn’t exactly run the Patriots out of his town.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Despite being inaccurate (17 for 32, 176 passing yards, 2 TDs), he was able to limit the turnovers to just one (backwards lateral). He’s still as smart as he was during his prime and will find a way to beat you, given his maniacal preparation. This is evidenced by the fact that although this is his fourth Super Bowl appearance, the coach accompanying him this time (Gary Kubiak) will be the fourth different head coach Manning has taken to the Super Bowl.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Manning’s versatility and leadership is the biggest reason why he makes any team an instant contender. He has proven that he can succeed in any offense – despite struggling this season – no matter what personnel is grouped around him.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The Sheriff might not be as scary as he once was, but he sure as hell knows how to beat you. And given that dominant Broncos defense, that may be enough this one last time.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>2. Defense Wins Championships</b></p></div>
		
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">As mentioned previously, this is Manning’s fourth Super Bowl appearance. However, it will be his first with a team that is led by its defense. Denver ranks first in the league in total defense, giving up 4,530 net yards for an average of 283.1 yards per game. They yielded the fewest net passing yards by giving up 3,193 yards for an average of 199.6 yards per game. They also ranked third in net yards on the ground, giving up 1,337 yards for an average of 83.6 yards per game. They ranked fourth in net points (allowing 296), which equates to 18.5 points per game. Their 25 forced fumbles (tied for first), 13 fumble recoveries (fourth-best), and 14 interceptions (13th-best) have clearly set the tone for a no-nonsense defensive juggernaut.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Von Miller, Chris Harris Jr., and Derek Wolfe were all on the IR a couple of years ago when the Seahawks annihilated the Broncos in the Super Bowl. This year, they are all healthy and all are clearly huge parts of this Broncos defense. Wolfe and Malik Jackson will have to control the interior and force the Panthers into passing situations. Miller and DeMarcus Ware will have to contain Cam Newton and Jonathan Stewart by both controlling the Panthers’ running game and effectively reading the read-option. Danny Trevathan, Brandon Marshall, and T.J. Ward will have to be effective going up against tight end Greg Olsen, who can change the outlook of a drive with a soul-crushing, open-field catch-and-run. However, Chris Harris Jr. and Aqib Talib ultimately shouldn’t have a hard time locking down the Panthers receivers, since they did a formidable job containing the Steelers and the Patriots wideouts.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>3. Run C.J., Run!</b></p></div>
		
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">C.J. Anderson will have to have a great day rushing the ball. The Panthers feature a scary defense, arguably better than even that of the Broncos. The Cardiac Cats are very physical on defense. In fact, they were sixth-best in the league with 44 sacks, first with 24 picks, tied for third with 24 forced fumbles, and first with 15 fumble recoveries.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Manning isn’t what he used to be and everyone knows that. That’s why C.J. Anderson and Ronnie Hillman are crucial to the success of this Denver offense. Manning will not be able to throw the ball 40 times and beat the caliber of defense that the Panthers boast. He will have to control the offensive tempo and time of possession with the run game. If Anderson and Hillman are effective on the ground, it will, in time, open up the play-action for Manning and his receivers to start their ignition sequence.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>4. This Ain’t No Omaha!</b></p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">One of the more underappreciated aspects of this Super Bowl 50 has been “comfort.” As we all know, comfort usually breeds positive results for sports teams. This is why teams fare better at home than they do away from home. The objective of a Super Bowl host city is to provide a neutral setting for both squads such that no major advantages are afforded to either team. However, it’s common knowledge that the Denver area is only one hour ahead of the Bay Area and, hence, the adjustment process should be much easier for the Broncos (on paper). The Panthers, on the other hand, will have internal clocks that are still three hours ahead when Super Bowl 50 kicks off this Sunday evening, and this discomfort may upset the natural order of things for Carolina.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">To counteract such adverse effects in performance, teams usually travel to the host city (Santa Clara, in this case) a week early. But despite these advance preparations, the fact remains that Denver will only have to deal with the changes in elevation, while the Panthers will have to contend with changes in entire coasts. Can Ron Rivera’s men take advantage of this apparent disadvantage? Or will they begin the game lethargically and homesick? An early momentum swing in the favor of the Broncos could ultimately decide this game. Don’t count out this important factor, folks.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>5. Will The Sheriff’s Backup Arrive?</b></p></div>
		
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Manning’s struggles this season have been well documented. I’m sure his star wide receivers, Emmanuel Sanders and Demariyus Thomas, feel intense added pressure, since it will be upon them to help their quarterback succeed. Going up against a Carolina secondary that features Josh Norman, Roman Harper, and Kurt Coleman will be a herculean task. To have success against this secondary, Sanders, Thomas, and company will have to run their routes effectively and get separation, especially on bump-and-runs.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In addition, whenever Thomas, Sanders, and the other receivers get thrown in those one-on-one matchups, they will have to make the most of it and deliver huge plays. If Hillman and Anderson are successful running the ball early on, that will open up the play-action pass, which should be integral in granting Manning’s receivers access to some one-on-one coverage.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>My Prediction</b></p></div>
		
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">To be sure, if they truly want to send Peyton Manning out as a winner, the Broncos must get comfortable with the fact that they have a difficult task on their plates. The Panthers are a high-powered, quick-strike offense. The Broncos consistently struggle to put points on the board. A victory against this Panthers team won’t come on a silver platter: The Denver Broncos will need <em>everything</em> to go right for them. Unfortunately, I don’t see that happening. In the end, Cam Newton will become the second player to win a National Championship, the Heisman, an MVP, and a Super Bowl with a well-deserved 24-10 victory on Super Bowl Sunday.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>Nate Preval:</b> This weekend, we will be seeing the largest age gap between starting quarterbacks in Peyton Manning and Cam Newton, a wide chasm spanning 13 years and 48 days. This gap has shown up on the field as well, since both of these teams have put up some incredible - and some not so great - numbers this season, given their immaturity in some areas (Josh Norman vs. Odell Beckham Jr.) and their experience in others (Broncos adjusting to Osweiler more easily than expected). Nonetheless, with confidence, any Carolina fan could - and should - believe that the Panthers have this game in the bag, even though game hasn’t even kicked off yet. The Denver Broncos’ fans, as well as those of the Atlanta Falcons, New Orleans Saints, and Tampa Bay Bucs, would be forgiven for wondering why on Earth Panthers Nation would possibly think that? Well, let’s consult some statistics.</p></div>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Obviously, over the last three weeks in the NFL, the Carolina Panthers have emerged as the most fun team to watch. They bring a newfound energy to the game, which many “critics” have not seen before. Led by the especially talented and charismatic Cam Newton, the Panthers have drawn those “Are you with us or against us?” parallels with their #KeepPounding hashtags and their evergreen Dab Dynasty. Newton has seen quite a bit of flack this week as “journalists” seem to have posed some irksome questions about his race comments from last week. And even more benign questions regarding his brand and fashion sense have been raised ahead of the biggest game of his life - hey media, give it a rest.</p></div>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Anyways, the Panthers have the stronger offense heading into Sunday’s big matchup against the Broncos. Their main concern, Von Miller, stands at 6’3, 250 pounds (with a 40 time of 4.49). The veteran DeMarcus Ware, who joined forces with Miller en route to delivering 18.5 sacks this season (including the playoffs), will look for gaps to exploit in a usually poised Panthers’ O-line. They both made a genuine mess of the Patriots’ offensive line in the AFC championship, not once affording Tom Brady the chance to get anything going (although it seems more like the Pats’ coaching staff got caught with their hands in the cookie jar when rolling out those trick plays). What will keep the Broncos’ defense from making the same mess this week is the Panthers’ offensive line, which has valiantly protected Cam this postseason, which has, in turn, opened up the run.</p></div>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>1. The Blind Side Protection</b></p></div>
		
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The offensive line has allowed the Panthers’ offense to flourish on their backs. The O-line, which includes Michael Oher of <em>The Blind Side</em> fame, has been a steel curtain for Cam, as he’s only been sacked twice this postseason. Apart from that, a 70% completion rate for their dabbin’ QB would not be possible if it were not for the O-line’s selfless protection. A bigger accomplishment than the two just mentioned is that the offensive line has allowed the Carolina rushing attack to continue a streak of 30+ games with over 100 yards rushing. The Panthers have managed to lead the league in rushing this postseason, as well as leading in scoring, although all of the scoring does not come at the hands of the offense, since Cam Newton has accounted for 50 touchdowns this season, a league record.</p></div>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>2. The Cam Corollary</b></p></div>
		
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The Broncos have no way to account for Cam Newton physically. Standing at roughly 6’5” and 250 pounds, Cam Newton is the most athletic quarterback the Broncos defense has faced this season. Besides, the fact that Cam can throw the ball exceptionally well in the pocket AND he can also run to collect first downs will be enough for the Cardiac Cats to keep pounding. We have not seen a whole lot of Cam’s rushing this postseason, but when necessary, that lead shoulder will drop and the pads will hit the Broncos’ defense in the numbers, resulting in either a first down or a touchdown. If Cam gets in the endzone a few times this weekend, prepare to see history being made.</p></div>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>3. A Defensive Sky Full of Stars</b></p></div>
		
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Peyton Manning has not seen a collective defense like that of the Panthers. With Thomas Davis and Luke Kuechly causing havoc through the middle, and with the D-line - featuring Kawaan Short, Jared Allen, Charles Johnson, and Star Lotulelei - pushing the Broncos O-line all day, it will be hard for Peyton Manning to get the ball off with ease. On top of that, Manning is nursing a torn plantar fascia in his left foot, causing him to have to sort of leap into his passes, making his throws even less powerful and giving them some hang time, which is something that Josh Norman and Kurt Coleman will look forward to exposing all game long. Peyton is having an abysmal (to his standards) and lucky postseason, only adding two touchdowns to his season total (with zero interceptions). Fortunately, their defense has made up for his lack of explosiveness in the pocket.</p></div>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>4. Got a running game, Denver?</b></p></div>
		
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">To add to the pile of issues, the Broncos do not have a steady run game. If it were not for C.J. Anderson willing his way to 30+ yard runs in both of their games this postseason, Manning would be depending on his arm to get them up the field, a blueprint to catastrophe considering how very far he is from his prime. The Panthers have a decent standing against the run, especially with the cast of guys mentioned above. As a result, Manning’s ability to be a “game manager,” as Yogi alluded to above, will be hard to see through, given Kuechly’s proven ability to check the QB’s audibles at the line pre-snap. But the true downfall will arise due to the Broncos’ shaky run game, which is understandable when your opponent is this high-energy Carolina defense.</p></div>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>5. Too Hot To Handle</b></p></div>
		
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In past Super Bowl appearances, Manning and company have completely cracked under pressure. While he won his lone Super Bowl in the 2006-2007 season, the rest of his appearances in football’s grandest game have been well short of spectacular. And when you have collected more interceptions than touchdowns in Super Bowls (as Manning has done), it’s a surefire recipe for disaster. His ability to rally the troops in times of grave pressure has generally proved to be lackluster. Now the case can also be made that this appearance will be different because it is his last one, but that argument would be rendered futile due to his knack for building momentum towards the big game. This season, in particular, has not been the best for Denver’s No. 18, especially when he was benched, in favor of Brock Osweiler, as he nursed his foot injury.</p></div>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph_header"><p class="epl_paragraph_text"><b>My Prediction</b></p></div>
		
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">On either side of the spectrum, there are cases to be made for either team, but the statistics are showing that despite how well the Broncos defense has been this season and despite how great of a game manager Peyton Manning has been in his career, the Carolina Panthers simply have the complete package. This holistic completeness is a common trait for Manning’s Super Bowl oppositions. The Drew Brees-led Saints were the definition of “complete” when they defeated Manning’s former team, the Colts, in 2010. The Russell Wilson-led Seattle Seahawks were also rounding into an elite, young juggernaut when they clashed with Manning’s Broncos in Super Bowl 48 just two seasons ago.</p></div>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">By all accounts, Riverboat Ron Rivera is the captain of a 52-story barge in the Carolina Panthers that is built to dominate in the years to come. No matter how much I have tried, I just can’t envision this game being won by the Broncos with ease. Instead, Rivera will do what he has done all season long: Construct a detail-oriented gameplan and provide leadership when necessary.</p></div>	
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Having said all of this, I believe “Super Cam” will be smiling all the way to a Super Bowl 50 MVP trophy. Oh, and his Panthers team will earn their franchise’s first Super Bowl win with a score of 27-17. Let the (early) celebrations commence!</p></div>
