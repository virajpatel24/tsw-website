				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This past weekend was an absolute nightmare for the both the New York Giants and their fans. Upon dealing with the hangover that arrived as a stark reminder of the one-point loss to the Patriots, Victor Cruz confirmed that he would be having season ending surgery on his calf, something that all fans knew would be inevitable after the fourth week of the season. Some slightly better news followed the Cruz declaration: the Giants have officially resigned Hakeem Nicks, one of the Super Bowl winning receivers from years prior, for the rest of the season in Cruz’s absence. However, Nicks has also had a myriad of lower body injuries throughout his career that have prevented him from making a strong return to football during the better part of the last two seasons.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Now to the hangover.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The Giants have managed to let yet ANOTHER game slip away against the undefeated Patriots. Earlier this season they had already managed to lose key games late to the Cowboys, Falcons, and Saints. And now they fell to their arch nemesis, the Tom Brady-led New England Patriots.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">When the game began, it slowly became what no one expected: A close one worsened by some sluggish offense from both teams. It wasn’t until the Patriots managed to charge down the field for their first touchdown of the game (Brady delivered a pass to Scott Chandler across the middle) that got the Giants rolling. On the next drive, Eli connects with OBJ for an 87-yard touchdown. The spectacular play was only surpassed by this fact: The Eli-to-Beckham connection would go down as the longest touchdown ever against a Bill Belichick team. For Giants fans like myself, this sudden upstart wasn’t a cause for unbridled optimism since this virtuoso performance wasn’t seen again until the fourth quarter.</p></div>

				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sNCo6lmzRor8g3u_BhxXlz4QoAo=/0x533:3066x2577/2400x1600/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/47670389/usa-today-8928671.0.jpg" target="_blank">WWW.PATSPULPIT.COM</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">In a weak response to the Giants score, the Pats seem to be getting stifled by the undying avalanche of pass-rushing coming thanks to Jason Pierre-Paul, who started at defensive end for the first time all season since his <a href="http://nypost.com/2015/07/05/jason-pierre-paul-severely-injures-hand-in-fireworks-accident/" target="_blank">July 4th incident and surgery</a> on his hand. That club on the hand surely seems heavy, but he continues to push forward. Next time out, the Patriots have a three-and-out and allow the Giants to come down the field with their offense rolling. Eli connects with Harris in the corner for a solid grab inbounds for the touchdown.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Later on, the Giants are forced to punt with Amendola on the receiving end. He takes off and goes virtually untouched until tripped up by one of his blockers just a few mere strides from the end zone. Patriots punch it in with LeGarrette Blount for the touchdown. At this point, the score is 17-20 in the Giants’ favor coming late in the third quarter. The Giants cannot get anything going on the following drive, so they give it back to the Pats. On a play-action pass, Brinkley makes a great hit on Brady, resulting in a sack fumble and a turnover for the Giants in field goal range.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Psycho Tom is in full effect at this point. Next drive, he connects with Gronk across the middle with the safeties taking probably the WORST pursuit angles ever on a man-beast of Gronk’s stature, resulting in the inevitable touchdown for the Patriots. The score is now 24-23 in the Patriots’ favor early in the fourth quarter. Giants cannot respond quickly enough so the Patriots get the ball back with time on the clock to spare. They do march right down the field, but Brady throws an untimely interception in the red zone, giving the Giants possession and plenty of time. Giants finally get their offense rolling, but they also have to be cognizant of the amount of time remaining on the clock so that they don’t leave Brady any time once they score.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Speaking of which, this truly may be the biggest pitfall the Giants have faced to date: clock management. As mentioned at the beginning of the post, the Giants have lost four games this season, including this one, to absolutely piss poor clock management. With a little over a minute-and-a-half left, the Giants are unable to get a touchdown pass in after a questionable call of an incomplete pass to OBJ. They happened to run three consecutive pass plays in the red zone (why on Earth do this???), leaving them with just the field goal. But, more importantly, they left Psycho Tom ninety seconds to get the ball upfield. Brady makes a long heave upfield that ends up being an overthrow. Collins, the Giants’ safety, gets two hands on the ball but once his back hits the ground, since he stretched out so far to attempt to catch it, the ball comes loose as an incomplete pass. With Edelman gone with a broken foot, passes to Amendola and Gronk get the Pats upfield, and just barely in field goal range. Stephen Gostkowski, taking the game-winning kick, absolutely drills the ball - nothing but leg - dead center and through the uprights, allowing the Pats’ to seal the deal and remain undefeated.</p></div>

				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width960/img/njcom_photos/photo/2015/11/16/-1ec0392949290696.JPG" target="_blank">WWW.IMAGE.NJ.COM</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This loss, again, is the FOURTH loss in the fourth quarter that the Giants have coughed up this season. Is anyone up for a change in coaching staff? Tom Coughlin had been rumored to be leaving the team soon. Maybe the offensive coordinator, Ben McAdoo, needs to be less aggressive in the play call to Eli Manning and really just allow the players to close these games. As both a Giants fan and someone just applying constructive criticism, these players cannot be any less discouraged not being able to make their recent record with the Patriots a heart-warming 4-0, as opposed to having this loss on their minds for the next two weeks (this is the Giants' bye week) until they meet their division rivals, the Redskins. Surely they can close that one out…right???</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">With JPP back, Hicks apparently healthy enough to sign for the team, and Beckham proving time and time again he will be able to make catches for his quarterback, and Prince Amukamara potentially returning from injury after the bye week, the Giants have absolutely no reason to find themselves losers in this division for the remainder of the season.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">But I suppose more bizarre things have happened. The last time the Giants lost a close one like this to the undefeated Patriots in 2007, Tom Brady continued to lead the team to an undefeated season. But, they ended that perfect run and season (<a href="../../../contributors/viraj-patel-archives/all-works-vp.html">much to someone’s dismay here at <em>The Sport Whorl</em></a>) by losing in that year’s Super Bowl to, you guessed it, the opportunistic New York Football Giants.</p></div>
