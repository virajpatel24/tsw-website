				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">This past Sunday, Carolina remained undefeated against their best competition to date this season, the Green Bay Packers. Plenty of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fancy-stats/wp/2015/10/13/patriots-are-clearly-the-nfls-best-undefeated-nfl-panthers-the-worst/" target="_blank">analysts and professionals</a> around the league had been calling them <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/carolina-panthers/post/_/id/16405/worst-4-0-team-in-the-league-not-dwelling-on-post-bye-blues-or-history-versus-seattle" target="_blank">the weakest undefeated team</a> for weeks on end, but this win clearly proves their case for championship contention. After losing their first game the week prior to the Denver Broncos, the Packers definitely came into this game with the sour taste of defeat and something to prove.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Before the game even started, the major talking point was Cam removing a Packers banner from his stadium. Some call it “rude and arrogant,” I call it “respecting enemy territory.” Although football games are physical and violent, it is not a night at a WWE event. Simply wear your jersey and your cheesehead hat and we’ll all be on our merry way. The fact that this was even an issue makes the NFL even more laughable. But anyway…Julius Peppers, the former Carolina Panther turned Packer, was greeted with boos as his name was announced. Suffice it to say, he certainly embraced the love.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Carolina brought the energy in the first quarter and Cam eventually found a nice seam to scramble out of and gained twenty plus yards. Unfortunately, that particular drive was capped off only with a field goal. Green Bay responded with a long drive of their own that allowed Aaron Rodgers to find his tight end, Ryan Taylor, with a nice catch in the end zone. Little did they know that the floodgates would open and the Packers would find themselves in the three-and-business for most of the second quarter.</p></div>
				
				<img src="nov-nfl-article-images/cam-td.png" class="each_epl_image">
				<p class="epl_article_cover_photo_credit">PHOTOGRAPH BY <a class="epl_article_cover_photo_source_link" href="https://www.facebook.com/CarolinaPanthers/photos/a.171939546152393.42410.112088258804189/1074870059192666/" target="_blank">CAROLINA PANTHERS FACEBOOK ACCOUNT</a></p>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Carolina’s first score in the second was a slam-dunk of a quarterback run by Cam, which we’re all so accustomed to seeing by now that we almost take it for granted. A quick three-and-out by the Packers leaves Carolina with the opportunity to begin taking chances downfield, with plenty of time to work with. We all can agree that without Kelvin Benjamin, who suffered a torn ACL in preseason workouts, Carolina’s receiving core is suspect at best, but there are some reliable names like Greg Olsen and Jerricho Cotchery to rely upon. And in the second quarter, we see another receiver Devin Funchess catch a fifty yard bomb from Cam. Funchess is probably the least likeliest individual from the depleted Panthers receiving corps that we’d predict to make that great of a catch. The Cardiac Cats finished that drive off in typical Carolina fashion, a play-action pass out of the shotgun to a wide open Greg Olsen in the end zone. That was his second consecutive game with a touchdown pass and sixty plus yards receiving. In the absence of Benjamin, he has seemingly become the primary target of the Panthers’ passing game. Last season he received over a thousand yards and this year he is on pace to repeat that same achievement.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">With plenty of time still left in the second quarter, the Packers found themselves continuing to struggle and even committed a turnover via an untimely fumble that took place while they attempted to get their ground game going. Eventually, Carolina got the ball back and took a shot downfield to Philly Brown. He’s been notorious for dropping critical passes over the last few weeks, but this time he showed up with his hands ready and caught the ball just outside of double coverage for the timely touchdown, giving his team the 27-7 lead going into halftime.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Packers come out “guns blazing,” to quote a former Panthers player (<a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2015/10/06/cowboys-greg-hardy-return-suspension-guns-quote" target="_blank">who said it bad taste, though</a>). Rodgers connects with Randall Cobb on a long 53 yard pass for the touchdown. Let the shootout begin. The remainder of the 3rd quarter was a quiet one.  On the Panthers’ next drive, Cam connects with Funchess again for a 14 yard touchdown in tight coverage. Second big catch for him on the day and he truly earned the praises he received post-game from Coach Rivera. Packers come out and Rodgers connects with Starks on a screen pass that results in a 69 yard touchdown play. They go for two right after and convert with ease.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Panthers had clearly cooled off and gave the Packers the ball back only up by fifteen with plenty of time left on the clock. Packers go for it on fourth down and convert after a bit of botched coverage by Josh Norman. The cornerback later admitted that he should’ve went for the swat instead of the high-risk catch. That play proves costly as the Packers get across the goal line for the touchdown a few plays later. Now, the Panthers rarely find themselves in a damage control situation, but just like last week against the Colts, they have the ball late and can close the game out with a long drive and a score. On the first play, Cam throws an interception, giving Aaron Rodgers time and a short field has always proven costly in the past. Well, so much for my optimism.</p></div>

				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The Packers’ possession takes some time off the clock but Carolina’s defense had been stout all day despite Luke Kuechly suffering a minor ankle injury. The week prior, he made the late play on the ball to close the game out. This time, Rodgers gets time and some pressure from the pass rush, throws and is caught by Thomas Davis for the critical interception.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">The Packers let Rodgers get sacked 5 times in what would just be another rough day in the office for both their offense and defense. The Packers’ woeful defensive unit, though plagued with some injuries in their secondary, let Cam Newton and the high-octane Carolina offense score three passing touchdowns while allowing Cam to score one early with his legs. They also allowed 24 points to be scored in the second quarter, which is the most in Panther history since ‘99. Newton had one of his better games converting 15 for 30 passing on 297 yards and rushed 57 yards in nine carries. He enjoyed his second best QBR this season by posting a scintillating 104.4. Aaron Rodgers, despite his slow start, posted a QBR of 96.6 and continued his stellar season by throwing for four touchdowns.</p></div>
				
				<div class="each_epl_paragraph"><p class="epl_paragraph_text">Next week - Carolina faces the Tennessee Titans. Although, the Titans do not have the most impressive record (2-6), their rookie quarterback, Marcus Mariota, has shown time and time again that he can very well be a franchise quarterback and compete in this league for seasons to come. But, with a dreadful defense, it’ll be an uphill climb for them as Carolina’s defense is easily one of the best in the league, especially after their unraveling of Aaron Rodgers who simply could not get into a rhythm at all last week. But only time will tell.</p></div>
